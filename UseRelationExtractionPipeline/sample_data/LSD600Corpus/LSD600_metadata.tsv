9283796	Glycosylated hemoglobin level and carotid intimal-medial thickening in nondiabetic individuals. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study.	Diabetes care	1997	train	3	8	0	Glycosylated hemoglobin level and carotid intimal-medial thickening in nondiabetic individuals. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study.  OBJECTIVE: People with diabetes are at increased risk for cardiovascular events. However, questions remain about what role, if any, homeostatic glucose control plays in the development of cardiovascular disease among nondiabetic individuals. We investigated the relationship between HbA1c level and carotid intimal-medial thickening in normoglycemic individuals. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study among 208 normoglycemic individuals (fasting glucose < or = 6.4 mmol/l and no history of diabetes) who had carotid initial-medial thickening (case subjects) and 208 normoglycemic control subjects individually matched for age, sex, race, field center, and date of exam. Subjects were free-living men and women, aged 45-64 years at baseline, who participated in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. RESULTS: HbA1c levels, expressed as percent of total hemoglobin, ranged from 4 to 7% and correlated only modestly with single measurements of fasting glucose (r = 0.16) and fasting insulin (r = 0.14). The mean level of HbA1c was 5.18% among case subjects and 5.07% among control subjects (P = 0.004, paired t test). As compared with the first quartile of HbA1c the matched relative odds of being a case were 1.15, 1.33, and 2.30 for the second, third, and fourth quartiles, respectively (P = 0.005 for linear trend). After multivariate adjustment for age, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, BMI, smoking status, hypertension, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, fibrinogen, and education level, the respective relative odds estimates were 0.98, 1.07, and 1.88 (P = 0.16 for linear trend). When modeled linearly as a continuous variable and after adjustment for the above-mentioned covariates, a 1% point increment in HbA1c level was associated with 1.77 greater odds of being a case (95% CI, 0.9-3.5). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide some support to the hypothesis that in the absence of diabetes, homeostatic glycemic control is a risk factor for atherosclerosis.  
30267528	Prevalence of Pathological Gambling among Alcohol Addicts in Outpatient Treatment in the City of Zagreb: a Cross-Sectional Study.	Psychiatria Danubina	2018	train	18	8	2	Prevalence of Pathological Gambling among Alcohol Addicts in Outpatient Treatment in the City of Zagreb: a Cross-Sectional Study.  BACKGROUND: Various types of addictions often co-occur, particularly substance and behavioral ones, which affects the clinical course of mental health disorders as well as the efficacy of therapy and rehabilitation efforts. The present study aims to explore gambling activities and possible gambling addiction among alcoholics in an outpatient treatment in the city of Zagreb. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Gambling activities were assessed in 140 members of alcohol addiction clubs in the City of Zagreb (Croatia). Participants were undergoing treatment after being diagnosed by their psychiatrist with alcohol dependence syndrome based on ICD-10 criteria. Intensity of gambling-related problems was measured using the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), while intensity of alcohol addiction was assessed using DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder. All instruments were self-report forms and were completed using pen and paper in a group context during outpatient treatment. RESULTS: Pathological gambling was more prevalent in this clinical subsample than in general populations analysed in other studies. Alcohol addicts showing problematic or pathological gambling behaviors tended to play more highly addictive games (sports betting, slot machines, roulette). However, intensity of gambling-related problems did not correlate significantly with the intensity of alcohol addiction. CONCLUSION: These results confirm studies from other countries showing higher prevalence of problematic and pathological gambling among alcohol addicts than in the general population. Gambling behavior in our sample more often involved games with greater addictive potential. These findings suggest that alcohol addicts should be systematically screened for problematic and pathological gambling, which may improve therapeutic efficacy and rehabilitation, as well as reduce relapse in addictive behavior in general.  
26869182	Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of body psychotherapy in the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia: a multicentre randomised controlled trial.	Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)	2016	train	12	5	0	Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of body psychotherapy in the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia: a multicentre randomised controlled trial.  BACKGROUND: The negative symptoms of schizophrenia significantly impact on quality of life and social functioning, and current treatment options are limited. In this study the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group body psychotherapy as a treatment for negative symptoms were compared with an active control. DESIGN: A parallel-arm, multisite randomised controlled trial. Randomisation was conducted independently of the research team, using a 1 : 1 computer-generated sequence. Assessors and statisticians were blinded to treatment allocation. Analysis was conducted following the intention-to-treat principle. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, a health and social care perspective was adopted. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: age 18-65 years; diagnosis of schizophrenia with symptoms present at > 6 months; score of >= 18 on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative symptoms subscale; no change in medication type in past 6 weeks; willingness to participate; ability to give informed consent; and community outpatient. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: inability to participate in the groups and insufficient command of English. SETTINGS: Participants were recruited from NHS mental health community services in five different Trusts. All groups took place in local community spaces. INTERVENTIONS: Control intervention: a 10-week, 90-minute, 20-session group beginners' Pilates class, run by a qualified Pilates instructor. Treatment intervention: a 10-week, 90-minute, 20-session manualised group body psychotherapy group, run by a qualified dance movement psychotherapist. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was the PANSS negative symptoms subscale score at end of treatment. Secondary outcomes included measures of psychopathology, functional, social, service use and treatment satisfaction outcomes, both at treatment end and at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 275 participants were randomised (140 body psychotherapy group, 135 Pilates group). At the end of treatment, 264 participants were assessed (137 body psychotherapy group, 127 Pilates group). The adjusted difference in means of the PANSS negative subscale at the end of treatment was 0.03 [95% confidence interval (CI) -1.11 to 1.17], showing no advantage of the intervention. In the secondary outcomes, the mean difference in the Clinical Assessment Interview for negative symptoms expression subscale at the end of treatment was 0.62 (95% CI -1.23 to 0.00), and in extrapyramidal movement disorder symptoms -0.65 (95% CI -1.13 to -0.16) at the end of treatment and -0.58 (95% CI -1.07 to -0.09) at 6 months' follow-up, showing a small significant advantage of body psychotherapy. No serious adverse events related to the interventions were reported. The total costs of the intervention were comparable with the control, with no clear evidence of cost-effectiveness for either condition. LIMITATIONS: Owing to the absence of a treatment-as-usual arm, it is difficult to determine whether or not both arms are an improvement over routine care. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with an active control, group body psychotherapy does not have a clinically relevant beneficial effect in the treatment of patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. These findings conflict with the review that led to the current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines suggesting that arts therapies may be an effective treatment for negative symptoms. FUTURE WORK: Determining whether or not this lack of effectiveness extends to all types of art therapies would be informative. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN842165587.

27399985	Substrate kinetics in patients with disorders of skeletal muscle metabolism.	Danish medical journal	2016	train	13	22	6	Substrate kinetics in patients with disorders of skeletal muscle metabolism.  The main purpose of the following studies was to investigate pathophysiological mechanisms in fat and carbohydrate metabolism and effect of nutritional interventions in patients with metabolic myopathies and in patients with severe muscle wasting. Yet there is no cure for patients with skeletal muscle disorders. The group of patients is heterozygous and this thesis is focused on patients with metabolic myopathies and low muscle mass due to severe muscle wasting. Disorders of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) are, along with myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease), the most common inborn errors of metabolism leading to recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis in adults. Prolonged exercise, fasting, and fever are the main triggering factors for rhabdomyolysis in these conditions, and can be complicated by acute renal failure. Patients with low muscle mass are in risk of loosing their functional skills and depend on a wheel chair and respiratory support. We used nutritional interventions and metabolic studies with stable isotope technique and indirect calorimetry in patients with metabolic myopathies and patients with low muscle mass to get information of the metabolism of the investigated diseases, and to gain knowledge of the biochemical pathways of intermediary metabolism in human skeletal muscle. We have shown that patients with fat metabolism disorders in skeletal muscle affecting the transporting enzyme of fat into the mitochondria (carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency) and affecting the enzyme responsible for breakdown of the long-chain fatty acids (very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) have a normal fatty acid oxidation at rest, but enzyme activity is too low to increase fatty acid oxidation during exercise. Furthermore, these patients benefit from a carbohydrate rich diet. Oppositely is exercise capacity worsened by a fat-rich diet in these patients. The patients also benefit from IV glucose, however, when glucose is given orally just before exercise, exercise capacity is worsened, most likely due to the sympatho-adrenergt response, that increases heart rate and blocks gluconeogenesis. Substrate turnover studies in patients with McArdle disease and phosphorylase b kinase deficiency showed that palmitate lipolysis, utilization and plasma concentration was higher and total CHO lower in the patients during exercise vs. healthy subjects. In patients with low muscle mass glucose homeostasis is impaired, and our findings showed that these patients are prone to develop hypoglycaemia during prolonged fasting. The following studies emphasize the importance of skeletal muscle in production of energy, both when skeletal muscle lack important metabolic enzymes (metabolic myopathies), and when skeletal muscle mass is low.  
17846454	The effects of signage and the physical environment on stair usage.	Journal of physical activity & health	2007	train	8	0	0	The effects of signage and the physical environment on stair usage.  BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) is a health behavior that most Americans do not participate in at recommended levels. METHODS: We sought to increase PA by use of motivational signs in selected buildings. Because physical environments are known to influence PA, the relationship of building characteristics and stair usage was also assessed. One pre- and two post-intervention observations were conducted. RESULTS: The proportion of those using the stairs increased from baseline to the second data collection, (chi2 = 39.31, p < 0.01) and baseline to a final data collection (chi2 = 10.1, p < 0.01). Built environment factors, including steps to the next higher floor and the number of floors in the building were consistent predictors of stair use. With signs positioned, the visibility of the stairs while standing in front of elevators became a significant predictor of stair usage. CONCLUSIONS: Motivational signs and characteristics of built environments are associated with increased stair usage.  
31837974	Social inequalities in multimorbidity, frailty, disability, and transitions to mortality: a 24-year follow-up of the Whitehall II cohort study.	The Lancet. Public health	2020	train	19	9	0	Social inequalities in multimorbidity, frailty, disability, and transitions to mortality: a 24-year follow-up of the Whitehall II cohort study.  BACKGROUND: Social inequalities in mortality persist in high-income countries with universal health care, and the mechanisms by which these inequalities are generated remain unclear. We aimed to examine whether social inequalities were present before or after the onset of adverse health conditions (multimorbidity, frailty, and disability). METHODS: Our analysis was based on data from the ongoing Whitehall II cohort study, which enrolled British civil servants aged 35-55 years in 1985-88. Participants were assessed for three indicators of socioeconomic status (education, occupational position, and literacy) at age 50 years. Participants underwent clinical examinations (in 2002-04, 2007-09, 2012-13, and 2015-16) for assessment of frailty (two or more of low physical activity, slow walking speed, poor grip strength, weight loss, and exhaustion) and disability (two or more difficulties in bathing, dressing, going to the toilet, transferring, feeding, and walking). In addition, electronic health records were used to assess the incidence of multimorbidity (two or more of diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, arthritis, cancer, dementia, and Parkinson's disease) and mortality. In analyses adjusted for sociodemographic factors, we used multistate models to examine social inequalities in transitions from healthy state to adverse health conditions and subsequently to mortality. FINDINGS: Of 10 308 individuals in the Whitehall II study cohort, 6425 had relevant data available at 50 years and to the end of follow-up on Aug 31, 2017, and were included in our analysis. Participants were followed up for a median of 23.6 years (IQR 19.6-28.9). 1694 (26.4%) of 6425 participants developed multimorbidity, 1733 (27.0%) became frail, 692 (10.8%) had a disability, and 611 (9.5%) died. Multimorbidity (hazard ratio [HR] 4.12 [95% CI 3.41-4.98]), frailty (HR 2.38 [95% CI 1.93-2.93]), and disability (HR 1.73 [95% CI 1.34-2.22]) were associated with increased risk of mortality; these associations were not modified by socioeconomic status. In multistate models, occupation was the socioeconomic status indicator that was most strongly associated with inequalities in the transition from healthy state to multimorbidity (HR 1.54 [95% CI 1.37-1.73]), to frailty (HR 2.08 [95% CI 1.85-2.33]), and to disability (HR 1.44 [95% CI 1.18-1.74]). Socioeconomic status indicators did not affect transitions to mortality in those with multimorbidity, frailty, or disability. INTERPRETATION: Socioeconomic status affects the risk of multimorbidity, frailty, and disability, but does not affect the risk of mortality after the onset of these adverse health conditions. Therefore, primary prevention is key to reducing social inequalities in mortality. Of the three adverse health conditions, multimorbidity had the strongest association with mortality, making it a central target for improving population health.

22562221	Resistance training and the risk of colon and rectal cancers.	Cancer causes & control : CCC	2012	train	11	12	3	Resistance training and the risk of colon and rectal cancers.  PURPOSE: Although there is convincing evidence that physical activity reduces colon cancer risk, research in this area has focused on aerobic activity. We conducted a case-control study to investigate whether resistance training was associated with the risk of colon and rectal cancers. METHODS: Data were collected on various colorectal cancer risk factors, including recreational physical activity performed during three age periods, from 870 cases and 996 controls in Western Australia in 2005-2007. Participants were classified as having never, possibly, or definitely performed resistance training in each age period and over the adult lifetime. The association between resistance training and colon and rectal cancer risk was analyzed using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Participants who definitely performed resistance training in their lifetime had a non-significant reduced risk of colon cancer compared with those who did no resistance training (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.70, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.45-1.11). No association was found for rectal cancer risk (AOR = 1.16, 95 % CI = 0.71-1.87). Performing resistance training was associated with a lower risk of colon cancer in each age period, although none of the relationships were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This study provides some initial evidence, albeit inconclusive, that resistance training may be inversely associated with colon cancer risk.

In 1996, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of a ""health claim"" based on the association between sugar replacers and the nonpromotion of dental caries. Small packages of products containing such sweeteners may state ""Does not promote tooth decay"" or ""May reduce the risk of tooth decay."" Larger packages must include additional information, such as ""Frequent eating of foods high in sugars and starches as between-meal snacks can promote tooth decay."" FDA criteria state that these products must not only be ""sugar-free,"" but they must also contain a noncariogenic sugar replacer and not lower plaque pH below 5.7 either during consumption or up to 30 minutes after consumption when tested by in vivo pH telemetry. Many people might reduce their caries risk by using sugar-free products, and the FDA claim can help consumers identity such products. Dental hygienists are ideal sources of consumer information about sugar replacers, and can help clients distinguish between the new FDA claim and advertising claims that are not regulated by FDA. The purpose of this article is to provide dental hygienists with information on sugar replacers that will help clients make appropriate nutrition choices.  "
24345987	Dyslipidemia, malnutrition, inflammation, cardiovascular disease and mortality in chronic kidney disease.	Current opinion in lipidology	2014	train	7	23	3	Dyslipidemia, malnutrition, inflammation, cardiovascular disease and mortality in chronic kidney disease.  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Dyslipidemia, malnutrition and inflammation are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and are strongly associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and increased mortality. The epidemiology of dyslipidemia and its interactions with malnutrition and inflammation in CKD patients have been the subject of much interest in the past decade. Recent clinical trials have explored the effects of statins on CVD specifically in CKD patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Whereas the risk relationship between total cholesterol level and CVD morbidity and mortality is direct, strong and progressive in CKD patients without malnutrition and inflammation, it is inconsistent and often paradoxical in those with malnutrition and inflammation. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that statins reduce significantly the risk of CVD in CKD patients before the initiation of dialysis. However, the beneficial effect of statins in CKD patients on dialysis is uncertain. In CKD patients on dialysis, malnutrition and inflammation pose a higher risk for CVD than dyslipidemia. SUMMARY: In CKD patients, the risk of CVD associated to dyslipidemia is complex and is modified by malnutrition and inflammation.  
29766400	Social media in the REI clinic: what do patients want?	Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics	2018	train	8	7	0	"Social media in the REI clinic: what do patients want?  PURPOSE: To elicit patient preferences for social media utilization and content in the infertility clinic. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey study conducted in three US fertility practices. Women presenting to the infertility clinic for an initial or return visit were offered an anonymous voluntary social media survey. The survey elicited patient perception of whether social media use in the infertility clinic is beneficial, and preferences regarding topics of interest. RESULTS: A total of 244 surveys were collected during the study period, of which 54.5% were complete. Instagram is a more popular platform than Twitter across all age groups. Use of both platforms varies by age, with patients >= 40 less likely to be active users. The majority of respondents felt that social media provided benefit to the patient experience in the infertility clinic (79.9%). ""Education regarding infertility testing and treatment"" and ""Myths and Facts about infertility"" were the most popular topics for potential posts, with 93.4 and 92.0% of patients endorsing interest respectively. The least popular topic was ""Newborn photos and birth announcements,"" with only 47.4% endorsing interest. A little over half of respondents (56.3%) would feel comfortable with the clinic posting a picture of their infant. The vast majority of patients (96.2%) feel comfortable communicating electronically with their infertility clinic. CONCLUSION: Patients are interested in the use of social media as a forum for patient education and support in the infertility clinic. Patient preferences regarding post topics should be carefully considered.  "

This concluding article of a two-part special section on the ethical group psychotherapist are highlighted: (1) the importance of the cultivation of the skill and knowledge base of the group psychotherapist in terms of pertinent legal statutes and ethical guidelines; (2) the criticalness of certain personality features related to the concept of virtue; (3) a therapist's self-awareness contributes to the capacities to think and respond ethically; (4) ethical decision making is most likely to occur when the group psychotherapist attends comprehensively to all dimensions that define the setting in which a dilemma emerges; and (5) that in the service of positive ethics, attention to the ethical dimensions of group psychotherapy practice should be continuously present. In agreement with other contributions to this section, I conclude that the commitment to the ethical practice of group psychotherapy must be made not only by the individual practitioner but also by educational and training programs and professional organizations.  
27443814	Associations between maternal periconceptional exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke and major birth defects.	American journal of obstetrics and gynecology	2016	train	30	26	14	Associations between maternal periconceptional exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke and major birth defects.  BACKGROUND: While associations between secondhand smoke and a few birth defects (namely, oral clefts and neural tube defects) have been noted in the scientific literature, to our knowledge, there is no single or comprehensive source of population-based information on its associations with a range of birth defects among nonsmoking mothers. OBJECTIVE: We utilized data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, a large population-based multisite case-control study, to examine associations between maternal reports of periconceptional exposure to secondhand smoke in the household or workplace/school and major birth defects. STUDY DESIGN: The multisite National Birth Defects Prevention Study is the largest case-control study of birth defects to date in the United States. We selected cases from birth defect groups having >100 total cases, as well as all nonmalformed controls (10,200), from delivery years 1997 through 2009; 44 birth defects were examined. After excluding cases and controls from multiple births and whose mothers reported active smoking or pregestational diabetes, we analyzed data on periconceptional secondhand smoke exposure-encompassing the period 1 month prior to conception through the first trimester. For the birth defect craniosynostosis, we additionally examined the effect of exposure in the second and third trimesters as well due to the potential sensitivity to teratogens for this defect throughout pregnancy. Covariates included in all final models of birth defects with >=5 exposed mothers were study site, previous live births, time between estimated date of delivery and interview date, maternal age at estimated date of delivery, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, nativity, household income divided by number of people supported by this income, periconceptional alcohol consumption, and folic acid supplementation. For each birth defect examined, we used logistic regression analyses to estimate both crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for both isolated and total case groups for various sources of exposure (household only; workplace/school only; household and workplace/school; household or workplace/school). RESULTS: The prevalence of secondhand smoke exposure only across all sources ranged from 12.9-27.8% for cases and 14.5-15.8% for controls. The adjusted odds ratios for any vs no secondhand smoke exposure in the household or workplace/school and isolated birth defects were significantly elevated for neural tube defects (anencephaly: adjusted odds ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-2.25; and spina bifida: adjusted odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.86); orofacial clefts (cleft lip without cleft palate: adjusted odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.81; cleft lip with or without cleft palate: adjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.46; cleft palate alone: adjusted odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.63); bilateral renal agenesis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-3.75); amniotic band syndrome-limb body wall complex (adjusted odds ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.51); and atrial septal defects, secundum (adjusted odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.72). There were no significant inverse associations observed. CONCLUSION: Additional studies replicating the findings are needed to better understand the moderate positive associations observed between periconceptional secondhand smoke and several birth defects in this analysis. Increased odds ratios resulting from chance (eg, multiple comparisons) or recall bias cannot be ruled out.  
25307527	Active cigarette smoking and risk of breast cancer.	International journal of cancer	2015	train	12	9	5	Active cigarette smoking and risk of breast cancer.  Although epidemiological evidence on the role of active cigarette smoking in breast cancer risk has been inconsistent, recent literature supports a modest association between smoking and breast cancer. This association is particularly observed in women who smoke for a long duration, or who smoke for a long time prior to their first pregnancy. Here, we provide updated results on cigarette smoking and breast cancer risk in the Canadian National Breast Screening Study (NBSS). The NBSS is a large cohort of 89,835 women, aged 40-59, who were followed for a mean of 22.1 years, resulting in the ascertainment of 6,549 incident cases of breast cancer. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of cigarette smoking variables with breast cancer risk. We found breast cancer to be associated with duration (40 years vs. 0: HR = 1.57; 95%CI = 1.29-1.92), intensity (40 cigarettes per day vs. 0: HR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.04-1.40), cumulative exposure (40 pack-years vs. 0: HR = 1.19; 95%CI = 1.06-1.13) and latency (40 years since initiation vs. 0: HR = 1.19; 95%CI = 1.10-1.53) of cigarette smoking. Number of years smoked prior to first full-term pregnancy was associated with higher risk of breast cancer than comparative years smoked post-pregnancy (among parous women, 5 years pre pregnancy vs. 0: HR = 1.18; 95%CI = 1.10-1.26). These results strongly support a role for cigarette smoking in breast cancer etiology and emphasize the importance of timing of this exposure.  
16251767	Asthma and the diver.	Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology	2005	train	11	17	0	Asthma and the diver.  Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba) diving has grown in popularity, with nearly 9 million sport divers in the United States alone. Approximately 7% of the population has been diagnosed with asthma, which is similar to the percentage of divers admitting they have asthma. Numerous concerns exist regarding subjects with asthma who choose to participate in recreational diving. Among these concerns are pulmonary barotrauma, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, arterial gas embolism, ear barotrauma, sinus barotrauma, and dental barotrauma. Despite these concerns, a paucity of information exists linking asthma to increased risk of diving complications. However, it has long been the norm to discourage individuals with asthma from participating in recreational scuba diving. This article examines the currently available literature to allow for a more informed decision regarding the possible risks associated with diving and asthma. It examines the underlying physiological principles associated with diving, including Henry's law and Boyle's law, to provide a more intimate understanding on physiological changes occurring in the respiratory system under compressive stress. Finally, this article offers a framework for guiding the patient with asthma who is interested in scuba diving. Under the right circumstances, the patient with asthma can safely participate in recreational diving without apparent increased risk of an asthma-related event.  
34220430	COVID-19: Sleep, Circadian Rhythms and Immunity - Repurposing Drugs and Chronotherapeutics for SARS-CoV-2.	Frontiers in neuroscience	2021	train	15	9	2	COVID-19: Sleep, Circadian Rhythms and Immunity - Repurposing Drugs and Chronotherapeutics for SARS-CoV-2.  The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has affected nearly 28 million people in the United States and has caused more than five hundred thousand deaths as of February 21, 2021. As the novel coronavirus continues to take its toll in the United States and all across the globe, particularly among the elderly (>65 years), clinicians and translational researchers are taking a closer look at the nexus of sleep, circadian rhythms and immunity that may contribute toward a more severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2-induced multi-organ failure affects both central and peripheral organs, causing increased mortality in the elderly. However, whether differences in sleep, circadian rhythms, and immunity between older and younger individuals contribute to the age-related differences in systemic dysregulation of target organs observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection remain largely unknown. Current literature demonstrates the emerging role of sleep, circadian rhythms, and immunity in the development of chronic pulmonary diseases and respiratory infections in human and mouse models. The exact mechanism underlying acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other cardiopulmonary complications in elderly patients in combination with associated comorbidities remain unclear. Nevertheless, understanding the critical role of sleep, circadian clock dysfunction in target organs, and immune status of patients with SARS-CoV-2 may provide novel insights into possible therapies. Chronotherapy is an emerging concept that is gaining attention in sleep medicine. Accumulating evidence suggests that nearly half of all physiological functions follow a strict daily rhythm. However, healthcare professionals rarely take implementing timed-administration of drugs into consideration. In this review, we summarize recent findings directly relating to the contributing roles of sleep, circadian rhythms and immune response in modulating infectious disease processes, and integrate chronotherapy in the discussion of the potential drugs that can be repurposed to improve the treatment and management of COVID-19.

Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking	2016	train	0	0	0	Deception Detection: The Relationship of Levels of Trust and Perspective Taking in Real-Time Online and Offline Communication Environments.  Where humans have been found to detect lies or deception only at the rate of chance in offline face-to-face communication (F2F), computer-mediated communication (CMC) online can elicit higher rates of trust and sharing of personal information than F2F. How do levels of trust and empathetic personality traits like perspective taking (PT) relate to deception detection in real-time CMC compared to F2F? A between groups correlational design (N = 40) demonstrated that, through a paired deceptive conversation task with confederates, levels of participant trust could predict accurate detection online but not offline. Second, participant PT abilities could not predict accurate detection in either conversation medium. Finally, this study found that conversation medium also had no effect on deception detection. This study finds support for the effects of the Truth Bias and online disinhibition in deception, and further implications in law enforcement are discussed.

The final version was pilot tested in three diverse community settings in Chicago to determine the efficacy of Asthma 1-2-3 at improving patient understanding of asthma and its symptoms. In all, 130 adults participated in the pilot test. Knowledge scores significantly improved from pretest to posttest following presentation of the developed tool for subjects across all literacy levels (Pretest: Mean = 4.2 [SD = 1.6]; Posttest: M = 6.8 [SD = 2.0], P < 0.001). Symptom pathophysiology concepts were the least understood. Individuals with low literacy had less total knowledge score gains compared to those with marginal and adequate literacy (1.8, 2.6, and 3.2 respectively; P = 0.002). The multimedia tool significantly improved understanding of asthma. Individuals with limited literacy may require additional instruction, repeated viewing, or added tangible cues (i.e. supplementary print materials) to support knowledge retention. In general, feedback from the target population was particularly helpful in the development of the tool and its initial evaluation, and should be considered as a necessary step in the creation of other patient education materials.  
8348054	Diversity in the association between occupation and lung cancer among black and white men.	Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology	1993	train	8	12	2	Diversity in the association between occupation and lung cancer among black and white men.  A population-based case comparison study of incident lung cancer and occupational risk factors was conducted in the tricounty Detroit metropolitan area. Nearly 6000 lung cancer cases and a comparison group of 3600 colon cancer cases were interviewed. This report includes 3792 white and black male lung cancer cases and 1966 black and white colon cancer referents. Cigarette smoking, age at diagnosis, and lifetime work history were assessed to determine the relationship between length of employment in specific occupations and industries and lung cancer. Diverse patterns of association between work history and lung cancer were observed for black and white men. Significant associations were seen between lung cancer and increasing length of employment in the following occupations: for white men, concrete and terrazzo finishers, grinding machine operators, heat treating machine operators, miscellaneous machine operators, truck drivers, driver sales, and laborers; for black men, farm workers, automobile mechanics, painting machine operators, furnace operators, and garbage collectors; for both black and white men, farmers, slicing and cutting machine operators, and garbage collectors. Distinct patterns for black and white men also were observed for length of employment by industry. This study clearly demonstrates the need to include black men in studies of occupational cancer etiology and to evaluate black and white men separately. It also indicates the necessity for cigarette smoking history to accurately assess workplace cancer risks. We propose guidelines for incorporating the use of biomarkers into further studies of occupational cancer epidemiology.

Journal of aging and physical activity	2021	train	10	0	0	Influence of Badminton Practice on Age-Related Changes in Patellar and Achilles Tendons.  Regular sport practice could prevent age-related changes in tendinous tissues. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of regular badminton practice on patellar and Achilles tendon mechanical properties in senior competitive badminton players (>35 years old) and to compare the results with physically active people matched by age. One hundred ninety-two badminton players and 193 physically active people were divided by age into four groups, between 35 and 44 (U45), between 45 and 54 (U55), between 55 and 64 (U65), and over 65 (O65) years old. A LogiqS8 transducer in elastography mode and a MyotonPRO myotonometer were used to assess patellar and Achilles mechanical properties. Achilles tendon stiffness was higher in the control group than the badminton players for the U45, U55, and O65 age groups (p < .01). Also, the elastography index was higher in the control group than the badminton players for the U45, U55, U65, and O65 age groups (p < .05). In conclusion, regular badminton practice could prevent the decline in mechanical properties of the patellar and Achilles tendons.  
11824216	Is couple therapy indicated for borderline personality disorder?	American journal of psychotherapy	2001	train	6	3	0	Is couple therapy indicated for borderline personality disorder?  The healing aspects of intimate relationships are being recognized by therapists and supported by empirical findings. Little has been written regarding the indications for couple therapy for individuals with borderline personality disorder. This paper proposes a three-level hierarchy for deciding on the suitability of couple therapy for patients with borderline personality disorder. The hierarchy is based on three separate borderline behavioral clusters--impulsive, identity, and affective--that should be utilized to direct the application of couple therapy to specific patients. The three levels are illustrated by case examples. Delineation of the indications for couple therapy for borderline patients will foster further theoretical and empirical work in the area.  
31863117	Sentinel approach to detect emerging causes of work-related respiratory diseases.	Occupational medicine (Oxford, England)	2020	train	12	18	11	Sentinel approach to detect emerging causes of work-related respiratory diseases.  BACKGROUND: The world of work is continually changing, and this could result in new and emerging risks being introduced, including those that may cause work-related respiratory diseases (WRRD). AIMS: To describe recently emerging and new cases of WRRD and the relevant methodology using data in a national occupational respiratory disease surveillance scheme in the UK. METHODS: Incident cases of respiratory diseases reported by physicians to the Surveillance of Work-related and Occupational Respiratory Disease (SWORD) between January 2015 and December 2017 were included. Potentially emerging respiratory hazards manifesting in SWORD data were identified with the following hierarchical approach: (i) new respiratory disease not previously associated with work, (ii) specific exposure/agent not previously associated with WRRD and (iii) industry and/or occupation not previously associated with WRRD. RESULTS: A total of 1215 cases of WRRD were reported to SWORD between January 2015 and December 2017. No new WRRD were identified. Thirteen potentially emerging causes of occupational asthma were identified, including exposures to agents such as ninhydrin. Four potential new causes were identified for interstitial pneumonia, which included wood and brass dust. Two potentially emerging causes of WRRD were identified for inhalational accidents (green coffee and nitrocellulose), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (diphenylmethane diisocyanate and salami mould), rhinitis (morphine and Amaranthus quitensis) and sarcoidosis (prions and horses). CONCLUSIONS: Continuous monitoring and reporting of any new work-related disease is a critical function of any occupational disease reporting scheme. Potential emerging causes of work-related health risks have been identified by using a simple and systematic way of detecting emerging causes of WRRDs.  
9669540	Priapism following trazodone overdose with cocaine use.	Annals of clinical psychiatry : official journal of the American Academy of Clinical Psychiatrists	1998	train	10	8	7	Priapism following trazodone overdose with cocaine use.  Priapism is a urologic disorder and medical emergency with a variety of known etiologies including the use of psychotropic medications. The antidepressant trazodone is the agent most frequently implicated in the precipitation of priapism. Additionally, a number of drugs of abuse including marijuana, ethanol, and cocaine have been known to cause the disorder. It is unknown if drugs may act in an additive or a synergistic manner to cause priapism. We report a case of priapism which occurred following trazodone overdose in an individual actively using cocaine. This case suggests that combined trazodone and cocaine use may pose an additional risk of priapism. Since trazodone is commonly employed as a hypnotic and often chosen for polysubstance abusers due to its low abuse potential, clinicians should be aware of the possible additive risk of priapism in this patient population.  
26472538	Ten years of experience with intravesical and intrasphincteric onabotulinumtoxinA in children.	Journal of pediatric urology	2016	train	0	17	0	Ten years of experience with intravesical and intrasphincteric onabotulinumtoxinA in children.  OBJECTIVE: To review 10 years of experience with both intravesical and intrasphincteric onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox((R))) injections in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty three children aged between 1 and 18 years at first injection had a combined total of 134 injections (106 intravesical, 23 intrasphincteric and five combined) between January 2004 and December 2013 at Princess Margaret Hospital. Follow-up occurred 3 months post procedure, and then 3-6 monthly. Response to Botox was graded according to the International Children's Continence Society (ICCS) response to treatment scale. Response time was the time that the injection remained effective before symptoms relapsed to the ICCS 'no response' category Neveus et al., 2006. RESULTS: Median response times to Botox by pathology are summarised in Table 1. For detrusor overactivity (DO), the response after each Botox injection was in the ICCS '>90% symptom reduction' category Neveus et al., 2006. Two children had sustained responses to Botox for a tenth and eleventh injection, respectively. A total of 45% of children receiving intrasphincteric Botox for chronic dysfunctional voiding (DV) or detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) had no symptom recurrence. Intravesical Botox was effective for treating new-onset hydronephrosis secondary to neurogenic bladder in one child. Intravesical Botox had a sustained effect over five injections in eliminating trigonal hypersensitivity and pain with CIC in one child. Episodes of severe autonomic dysreflexia in one child with a high cord transection were effectively eliminated by intravesical Botox, and were sustained over three injections. Thirteen of the 134 Botox injections (9.7%) had a symptomatic culture-positive urinary tract infection (UTI) in the 2 weeks following injection. All had a history of previous UTI. Three children (2.8%) developed urinary retention after intravesical injection. DISCUSSION: Intravesical Botox remained effective after up to eleven injections. In children with DV or DSD, the response to Botox was more variable, but 45% experienced symptom resolution with no recurrence. Trigonal hypersensitivity with CIC improved in a child after Botox. Botox may confer long-term bladder and upper tract protection in the neurogenic patient group. Severe episodes of autonomic dysreflexia triggered by bladder fill in a child with high cord lesion were eliminated by intravesical Botox. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that intravesical Botox remained effective in response quality and response time in children up to an eleventh injection. This is one of the longer follow-up studies in children published to date. Botox was effective in numbing trigonal hypersensitivity, treating new-onset hydronephrosis secondary to neurogenic bladder, and eliminating episodes of autonomic dysreflexia in one patient each.

Sleep health	2017	train	8	12	5	Association of sleep characteristics with cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in a population sample: the Chicago Area Sleep Study.  OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of sleep characteristics with prevalent hypertension, diabetes, and obesity in a multiethnic cohort. DESIGN: This study used a population-based cross-sectional study design. SETTING: Participants were recruited between 2009 and 2011 from Chicago, Illinois, and the surrounding suburbs. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 492 adults aged 35 to 64years who self-reported as white, black, Hispanic, or Asian and who had a low likelihood of sleep apnea based on the apnea screening questionnaires and 1 night of apnea screening using an in-home device (apnea hypopnea index <15 or oxygen desaturation index <10). MEASUREMENTS: Participants wore a wrist actigraphy monitor (Actiwatch(TM)) for 7days. During a clinical examination, participants completed questionnaires about sleep, other health behaviors, and medical history and had their blood pressure, anthropometric measures, and fasting blood glucose measured; metabolic risk factors were determined based on standard clinical guidelines. RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension, obesity, and diabetes was 17.1%, 5.5%, and 35.4%, respectively. Sleep duration was not associated with any cardiovascular risk factor. There was a significantly increased odds for hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.08) and obesity (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05) associated with higher sleep fragmentation (per 1%). There was also a significantly increased odds for hypertension associated with poorer self-reported sleep quality (OR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.05-1.24] per 1-unit higher Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score). CONCLUSION: Objective and self-reported sleep quality may be more important than duration in relation to prevalent hypertension.  
19203507	Hepatitis C virus infection in hemodialysis patients is not associated with insulin resistance, inflammation and atherosclerosis.	Clinical nephrology	2009	train	1	21	0	Hepatitis C virus infection in hemodialysis patients is not associated with insulin resistance, inflammation and atherosclerosis.  BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with increased levels of inflammatory markers and is also a significant risk factor for the development of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in the general population. In attempt to address this issue in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients, we evaluated the relation of HCV infection with inflammatory markers, endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. METHODS: In a cohort of 72 HD patients (36 (50%) had a positive HCV EIA test and 36 (50%) had a negative anti-HCV test), we examined HCV antibody status, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and beta-cell function (HOMA-beta), serum inflammatory parameters (high sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen and procalcitonin), and performed echocardiography, high-resolution brachial artery ultrasound and B-mode carotid Doppler examination to assess the vascular functions and atherosclerosis. RESULTS: There were no differences in age, gender, body mass index (BMI), primary disease, duration of dialysis, smoking status, laboratory parameters except glucose, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol between anti-HCV-positive and anti-HCV-negative groups. The serum concentrations of glucose, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were significantly lower in the anti-HCV-positive patients than anti-HCV-negative patients (p = 0.04, p = 0.02, p = 0.01, respectively). There were no significant differences in inflammatory parameters, total insulin secretion (HOMA-beta, p = 0.76) and insulin resistance (HOMA-R, p = 0.91) between anti-HCV-positive and negative patients. The intima media thickness, carotid plaque score and brachial artery endothelium-dependent dilatation did not differ significantly between the two groups (p = 0.44, 0.45, and 0.17, respectively). CONCLUSION: HCV infection was not related to atherosclerosis and insulin resistance in hemodialysis patients. Since hemodialysis patients had a large number of uremia-related cardiovascular risk factors, the effect of HCV infection could disappear in this group of patients.  
34601742	New Australian guidelines for the treatment of alcohol problems: an overview of recommendations.	The Medical journal of Australia	2021	train	46	27	6	"New Australian guidelines for the treatment of alcohol problems: an overview of recommendations.  OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND LEVELS OF EVIDENCE: Chapter 2: Screening and assessment for unhealthy alcohol use Screening Screening for unhealthy alcohol use and appropriate interventions should be implemented in general practice (Level A), hospitals (Level B), emergency departments and community health and welfare settings (Level C). Quantity-frequency measures can detect consumption that exceeds levels in the current Australian guidelines (Level B). The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is the most effective screening tool and is recommended for use in primary care and hospital settings. For screening in the general community, the AUDIT-C is a suitable alternative (Level A). Indirect biological markers should be used as an adjunct to screening (Level A), and direct measures of alcohol in breath and/or blood can be useful markers of recent use (Level B). Assessment Assessment should include evaluation of alcohol use and its effects, physical examination, clinical investigations and collateral history taking (Level C). Assessment for alcohol-related physical problems, mental health problems and social support should be undertaken routinely (GPP). Where there are concerns regarding the safety of the patient or others, specialist consultation is recommended (Level C). Assessment should lead to a clear, mutually acceptable treatment plan which specifies interventions to meet the patient's needs (Level D). Sustained abstinence is the optimal outcome for most patients with alcohol dependence (Level C). Chapter 3: Caring for and managing patients with alcohol problems: interventions, treatments, relapse prevention, aftercare, and long term follow-up Brief interventions Brief motivational interviewing interventions are more effective than no treatment for people who consume alcohol at risky levels (Level A). Their effectiveness compared with standard care or alternative psychosocial interventions varies by treatment setting. They are most effective in primary care settings (Level A). Psychosocial interventions Cognitive behaviour therapy should be a first-line psychosocial intervention for alcohol dependence. Its clinical benefit is enhanced when it is combined with pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence or an additional psychosocial intervention (eg, motivational interviewing) (Level A). Motivational interviewing is effective in the short term and in patients with less severe alcohol dependence (Level A). Residential rehabilitation may be of benefit to patients who have moderate-to-severe alcohol dependence and require a structured residential treatment setting (Level D). Alcohol withdrawal management Most cases of withdrawal can be managed in an ambulatory setting with appropriate support (Level B). Tapering diazepam regimens (Level A) with daily staged supply from a pharmacy or clinic are recommended (GPP). Pharmacotherapies for alcohol dependence Acamprosate is recommended to help maintain abstinence from alcohol (Level A). Naltrexone is recommended for prevention of relapse to heavy drinking (Level A). Disulfiram is only recommended in close supervision settings where patients are motivated for abstinence (Level A). Some evidence for off-label therapies baclofen and topiramate exists, but their side effect profiles are complex and neither should be a first-line medication (Level B). Peer support programs Peer-led support programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous and SMART Recovery are effective at maintaining abstinence or reductions in drinking (Level A). Relapse prevention, aftercare and long-term follow-up Return to problematic drinking is common and aftercare should focus on addressing factors that contribute to relapse (GPP). A harm-minimisation approach should be considered for patients who are unable to reduce their drinking (GPP). Chapter 4: Providing appropriate treatment and care to people with alcohol problems: a summary for key specific populations Gender-specific issues Screen women and men for domestic abuse (Level C). Consider child protection assessments for caregivers with alcohol use disorder (GPP). Explore contraceptive options with women of reproductive age who regularly consume alcohol (Level B). Pregnant and breastfeeding women Advise pregnant and breastfeeding women that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption (Level B). Pregnant women who are alcohol dependent should be admitted to hospital for treatment in an appropriate maternity unit that has an addiction specialist (GPP). Young people Perform a comprehensive HEEADSSS assessment for young people with alcohol problems (Level B). Treatment should focus on tangible benefits of reducing drinking through psychotherapy and engagement of family and peer networks (Level B). Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples Collaborate with Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander health workers, organisations and communities, and seek guidance on patient engagement approaches (GPP). Use validated screening tools and consider integrated mainstream and Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander-specific approaches to care (Level B). Culturally and linguistically diverse groups Use an appropriate method, such as the ""teach-back"" technique, to assess the need for language and health literacy support (Level C). Engage with culture-specific agencies as this can improve treatment access and success (Level C). Sexually diverse and gender diverse populations Be mindful that sexually diverse and gender diverse populations experience lower levels of satisfaction, connection and treatment completion (Level C). Seek to incorporate LGBTQ-specific treatment and agencies (Level C). Older people All new patients aged over 50 years should be screened for harmful alcohol use (Level D). Consider alcohol as a possible cause for older patients presenting with unexplained physical or psychological symptoms (Level D). Consider shorter acting benzodiazepines for withdrawal management (Level D). Cognitive impairment Cognitive impairment may impair engagement with treatment (Level A). Perform cognitive screening for patients who have alcohol problems and refer them for neuropsychological assessment if significant impairment is suspected (Level A). SUMMARY OF KEY RECOMMENDATIONS AND LEVELS OF EVIDENCE: Chapter 5: Understanding and managing comorbidities for people with alcohol problems: polydrug use and dependence, co-occurring mental disorders, and physical comorbidities Polydrug use and dependence Active alcohol use disorder, including dependence, significantly increases the risk of overdose associated with the administration of opioid drugs. Specialist advice is recommended before treatment of people dependent on both alcohol and opioid drugs (GPP). Older patients requiring management of alcohol withdrawal should have their use of pharmaceutical medications reviewed, given the prevalence of polypharmacy in this age group (GPP). Smoking cessation can be undertaken in patients with alcohol dependence and/or polydrug use problems; some evidence suggests varenicline may help support reduction of both tobacco and alcohol consumption (Level C). Co-occurring mental disorders More intensive interventions are needed for people with comorbid conditions, as this population tends to have more severe problems and carries a worse prognosis than those with single pathology (GPP). The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10 or K6) is recommended for screening for comorbid mental disorders in people presenting for alcohol use disorders (Level A). People with alcohol use disorder and comorbid mental disorders should be offered treatment for both disorders; care should be taken to coordinate intervention (Level C). Physical comorbidities Patients should be advised that alcohol use has no beneficial health effects. There is no clear risk-free threshold for alcohol intake. The safe dose for alcohol intake is dependent on many factors such as underlying liver disease, comorbidities, age and sex (Level A). In patients with alcohol use disorder, early recognition of the risk for liver cirrhosis is critical. Patients with cirrhosis should abstain from alcohol and should be offered referral to a hepatologist for liver disease management and to an addiction physician for management of alcohol use disorder (Level A). Alcohol abstinence reduces the risk of cancer and improves outcomes after a diagnosis of cancer (Level A).  "

Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology	2019	train	17	8	13	Systematic review: the etiology of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in low-income settings.  INTRODUCTION: Esophageal carcinoma causes over 380 000 deaths per year, ranking sixth worldwide in mortality amongst all malignancies. Globally, the squamous cell subtype is most common and accounts for 80% of esophageal cancers. Nonetheless, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is much more poorly understood than esophageal adenocarcinoma, including what is driving such high prevalences, why it often presents in young patients, and shows such marked geographical delineations Areas covered: The current literature was searched for articles focusing on aetiopathogenesis of squamous cell esophageal carcinoma via a systematic review, particularly in low-resource settings. This was supplemented by papers of interest known to the authors. Expert commentary: Current putative mechanisms include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrosamines, acetaldehyde, cyclo-oxygenase-2 pathways, androgen and their receptor levels, as well as smoking & alcohol, micronutrient deficiencies and diet, mycotoxins, thermal damage, oral hygiene and microbiotal factors, inhaled smoke, viral infections such as HPV, and chronic irritative states. Etiology is likely multifactorial and varies geographically. Though smoking and alcohol play a predominant role in high-income settings, there is strong evidence that mycotoxins, diet and temperature effects may play an under-recognized role in low and middle-income settings.  
17625932	Who are the long sleepers? Towards an understanding of the mortality relationship.	Sleep medicine reviews	2007	train	9	3	0	Who are the long sleepers? Towards an understanding of the mortality relationship.  While much is known about the negative health implications of insufficient sleep, relatively little is known about risks associated with excessive sleep. However, epidemiological studies have repeatedly found a mortality risk associated with reported habitual long sleep. This paper will summarize and describe the numerous studies demonstrating increased mortality risk associated with long sleep. Although these studies establish a mortality link, they do not sufficiently explain why such a relationship might occur. Possible mechanisms for this relationship will be proposed and described, including (1) sleep fragmentation, (2) fatigue, (3) immune function, (4) photoperiodic abnormalities, (5) lack of challenge, (6) depression, or (7) underlying disease process such as (a) sleep apnea, (b) heart disease, or (c) failing health. Following this, we will take a step back and carefully consider all of the historical and current literature regarding long sleep, to determine whether the scientific evidence supports these proposed mechanisms and ascertain what future research directions may clarify or test these hypotheses regarding the relationship between long sleep and mortality.

American journal of ophthalmology	2002	train	10	18	7	Risk factors for Type II diabetes and diabetic retinopathy in a mexican-american population: Proyecto VER.  PURPOSE: Risk factors for type II diabetes and diabetic retinopathy were determined in a population-based study of Mexican-Americans. DESIGN: Proyecto VER (Vision, Evaluation, and Research) is a cross-sectional study in a random sample of the self-described Hispanic populations in Tucson and Nogales, Arizona, age 40 and older. METHODS: Of 6,659 eligible subjects, 4,774 (72%) participated in the home questionnaire and clinic visit. Diabetes was defined as self-report of a physician diagnosis or hemoglobin A(1c) value of > or = 7.0%. Only type II diabetes was included. Diabetic retinopathy was assessed on stereo fundus photographs of all persons with diabetes. Questions were asked about demographic, personal, socioeconomic, and diabetes related variables. RESULTS: 1023 (21.4%) of the sample had type II diabetes, and 68% were in the low-income group (annual income less than $20,000). Diabetes was associated with Native-American ancestry, higher acculturation, low income, less education, and increasing body mass index after age and gender adjustment. Persons with previously undiscovered diabetes were more likely to have no regular source of care, no insurance, and currently smoke compared with persons with known diabetes. Only low income was related to proliferative retinopathy, once adjusted for other factors (odds ratio [OR] = 3.93, 95%, confidence limitations [CL] = 1.31-11.80). CONCLUSIONS: Several socioeconomic and other factors were associated with diabetes, but few were related to diabetic retinopathy. Persons in the low-income group appeared to be at greater risk of diabetes and the ocular complications of diabetes compared with those with more income. Further longitudinal studies in this population are needed to confirm the associations.

Journal of aging and physical activity	2020	train	19	0	0	Understanding the Relationship Between Pet Ownership and Physical Activity Among Older Community-Dwelling Adults-A Mixed Methods Study.  Pet ownership is associated with increased levels of physical activity (PA) in older adults. Studies have mainly focused on the association between PA and dog walking; however, broader aspects of pet ownership may influence PA. The purpose of this study was to explore the association between pet ownership and incidental and purposeful PA using a mixed methods approach. Participants' (N = 15) PA was measured for 7 days using accelerometers and diaries. Semistructured interviews explored participants' perspectives regarding pet-related activities. Participants' mean (SD) daily step count was 14,204 (5,061) steps, and mean (SD) sedentary time per day was 8.76 (1.18) hr. Participants strongly concurred that their pets were an integral part of their daily lives. Incidental and purposeful PA resulted from participants undertaking pet care and socially interacting with their pets. Pets may interrupt sedentary behaviors by nudging older adults to engage in PA as part of their daily lived experience.

Cancer causes & control : CCC	2009	train	17	8	6	Intake of folate, vitamins B6, B12 and methionine and risk of pancreatic cancer in a large population-based case-control study.  OBJECTIVE: Folate and other methyl-group nutrients may play a key role in pancreatic carcinogenesis through their effects on DNA integrity. We examined the association between pancreatic cancer and intake of folate, vitamins B(6), B(12) and methionine in a large population-based case-control study. METHODS: Risk factor data were collected during in-person interviews with 532 pancreatic cancer cases diagnosed in 1995-1999 and 1,701 frequency-matched controls in the San Francisco Bay Area. Dietary history and supplement use were obtained using a semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire developed at Harvard University. Adjusted unconditional logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) as estimates of the relative risk. RESULTS: Total folate intake was inversely associated with pancreatic cancer (5th vs. 1st quintile: OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.48-0.93, p (trend) = 0.04). Increased vitamin B(12) from food was positively associated with pancreatic cancer although risk estimates for quintiles 3-5 were similar (5th vs. 1st quintile: OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.3-2.6, p (trend) = 0.001). Intake of vitamin B(6) or methionine was not associated with pancreatic cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided some support for an inverse association between folate intake and pancreatic cancer risk. The increased pancreatic cancer risk with vitamin B(12) intake from food warrants further investigation.  
17971826	Sedentary behaviour, physical activity and a continuous metabolic syndrome risk score in adults.	European journal of clinical nutrition	2009	train	18	9	5	Sedentary behaviour, physical activity and a continuous metabolic syndrome risk score in adults.  OBJECTIVE: The association of sedentary behaviour and leisure time physical activity with a validated continuous metabolic syndrome risk score was investigated in adults. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A number of 992 adults (559 men) without cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Subjects reported time spent in leisure time physical activity and television watching/computer activities. A validated metabolic syndrome risk score, based on waist circumference, triglycerides, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, was used. The metabolic syndrome risk score and time spent in sedentary behaviour and physical activity were analysed as continuous variables using multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Metabolic syndrome risk was positively associated with time spent watching television/computer activities, irrespective of physical activity level, and after adjustment for age, education level, smoking status and dietary intake in women aged > or =45 years (beta=0.184, P<0.05). Independent of the time being sedentary, moderate to vigorous leisure time physical activity was inversely associated with metabolic syndrome risk in men (<45 years: beta=-0.183, P<0.01; > or =45 years: beta=-0.192, P<0.01) and women aged > or =45 years (beta=-0.203, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Although cross-sectional, the present results support inclusion of efforts to decrease sedentary behaviour in metabolic syndrome prevention strategies for women aged > or =45 years, besides promotion of moderate to vigorous physical activity, since both behavioural changes might show additional effects.

Journal of medicine and life	2020	train	12	19	4	Prevalence of Alcohol and Tobacco Use in India and Implications for COVID-19 - Niyantrita Madhumeha Bharata Study Projections.  Abuse of legal substances in India includes alcohol and tobacco, which are the major risk factors for various non-communicable diseases and deaths. The current pandemic has identified tobacco consumption as a risk factor for COVID-19, highlighting the need to control substance abuse. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of substance abuse in India and discuss the cost-effective public health strategies (such as yoga) to alleviate COVID-related anxiety in order to prevent substance abuse and its associated co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study reports the data on tobacco and alcohol abuse from a nationwide randomized two-arm diabetes control trial (Niyantrita Madhumeha Bharata, 2017) conducted by the Indian Yoga Association (IYA) through Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-VYASA), Bengaluru. Data of 30,354 participants who abuse tobacco and 30,159 participants who abuse alcohol were collected all over India. The prevalence is estimated at around 8.7% for alcohol abuse and 7.9% for tobacco abuse, Arunachal Pradesh state ranking the highest regarding both alcohol and tobacco abuse, while the Tripura state ranked the lowest. School and college-based mandatory yoga programs need to be implemented to prevent the increase of substance abuse in India to alleviate the psychosocial stress of adolescents and college-going students, besides the installation of the mindfulness-based diabetes yoga protocol (DYP) in the wellness centers of Ayushman Bharat.

European journal of nutrition	2007	train	10	0	0	Effect of pomegranate (Punica granatum) juice intake on hepatic oxidative stress.  Pomegranate juice (PJ) possesses a high antioxidant activity, which has been related to beneficial health properties. However, in vivo confirmation and characterization of these effects on biological systems are lacking and needed. This study was performed in order to investigate the effect of prolonged PJ ingestion on general oxidation status. For this purpose, mice ingested PJ (or water in control group) during four weeks, after which damage to lipids, proteins and DNA were evaluated as oxidative cell biomarkers. Levels of hepatic glutathione and the activities and expression of enzymes involved in its metabolism were determined. Catalase and SOD activities were quantified as these enzymes have a crucial role in antioxidant defence. Protection against protein and DNA oxidation was found in PJ group. There was also a significant decrease in GSH and GSSG, without change in the GSH/GSSG ratio. All studied enzymatic activities (GPx, GST, GR, SOD and catalase) were found to be decreased by PJ treatment. Additionally, RT-PCR results showed that GST and GS transcription were also decreased in this group. These results are compatible with a protective effect of PJ against systemic oxidative stress in mice.  
28766851	Folate deficiency in north Indian children undergoing maintenance chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia-Implications and outcome.	Pediatric blood & cancer	2018	train	5	20	0	Folate deficiency in north Indian children undergoing maintenance chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia-Implications and outcome.  BACKGROUND: Treatment-related toxicity and mortality are not uncommon during maintenance chemotherapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), especially in the low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies are commonly seen in children from LMICs undergoing treatment for ALL. The present study examines the prevalence and clinical implications of folate deficiency in north Indian children with ALL during the maintenance phase of treatment in view of prolonged antifolate treatment and high population prevalence of folate deficiency. PROCEDURES: Pre-cycle folate levels/deficiency as well as weight for age z-score and serum albumin level were determined and correlated with complications of treatment and mortality encountered during the maintenance phase of treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-nine of 52 children enrolled in the study had folate deficiency at some point during maintenance chemotherapy. Neutropenia (18 of 29 vs. 4 of 23; P = 0.002), thrombocytopenia (17 of 29 vs. 4 of 23; P = 0.005), febrile neutropenia (17 of 29 vs. 4 of 23; P = 0.005), and need for chemotherapy dose reduction (20 of 29 vs. 7 of 21; P = 0.01) were more common in folate-deficient children. Maintenance deaths were higher (8 of 29 vs. 1 of 23; P = 0.03) and survival lower (P = 0.02) in deficient children. In multivariate analysis, hypoalbuminemia (P = 0.02) and folate deficiency (P = 0.01) were associated with febrile neutropenia, and folate deficiency with maintenance deaths (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Folate deficiency was associated with treatment-related complications and adverse outcome in our patients. The risks and benefits of folate supplementation in deficient children during maintenance chemotherapy need to be explored with properly designed randomized studies in similar settings.

Journal of orofacial orthopedics = Fortschritte der Kieferorthopadie : Organ/official journal Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Kieferorthopadie	2016	train	3	0	0	Virtual setup: application in orthodontic practice.  BACKGROUND: A plaster dental model is a patient's traditional three-dimensional (3D) record. If the dental crowns from a plaster model are separated and positioned in wax, this setup of the crowns can be used to simulate orthodontic treatment. The traditional way to make this dental setup requires significant time by the orthodontist and in the orthodontic lab. New developments in dentistry and orthodontics include the possibility of virtual setups. AIM: In this article, the differences between conventional setups with plaster models and virtual setups are discussed. METHODS: A clinical patient is described for whom two different setups were made and compared by model superimposition with Geomagic Qualify software. RESULTS: According to the literature and the results from this study, virtual setups and conventional setups with plaster models are equally accurate. CONCLUSION: Virtual setups present several advantages, e.g., digital storage, digital models cannot be damaged, the same model can undergo several treatment simulations, and communication between dental and surgical professionals and between dental professionals and patients is facilitated. Despite these advantages, considerable time and training are needed for dental professionals to master and adopt the general use of digital models and virtual setups in dentistry.

Using newly available food composition data for carotenoids, the authors reanalyzed a population-based case-control study of diet and lung cancer conducted in Hawaii in 1983-1985 (L. Le Marchand et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 81: 1158-1164, 1989). The analysis included interviews with 230 men and 102 women with lung cancer and 597 men and 268 women as controls, frequency-matched to the patients by age and sex. A previously validated quantitative diet history assessed the usual intake of foods rich in carotenoids. After adjusting for smoking and other covariates, no association was found with lung cancer risk for dietary lycopene or beta-cryptoxanthin intake, whereas dose-dependent inverse associations of comparable magnitude were found for dietary beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and lutein. When subjects were cross-classified by their joint intakes of the latter three carotenoids, those who had a high intake (> median) for all three had the lowest risk for lung cancer. In a similar two-way interaction analysis, the previously reported inverse association of lung cancer with vegetable consumption in these data was found to be stronger than that with intake of these three carotenoids. Consistent with our previous findings, this analysis provides further evidence for a protective effect of certain carotenoids against lung cancer and for the greater protection afforded by consuming a variety of vegetables compared to only foods rich in a particular carotenoid.  
7890451	"""Experience-sharing"" as an antidote to dependence-making behavior of general practitioners."	International journal of group psychotherapy	1995	train	1	0	0	Experience-sharing as an antidote to dependence-making behavior of general practitioners.  This article explores how group-dynamic interventions can be used to teach health professionals to counter impulses to make clients dependent on them. The basic assumption, derived from Kohut's work on narcissism, is that dependence-making behavior is connected with deep-rooted feelings of insufficiency resulting from a defective autonomy. A part of the standard Dutch General Practice (GP) training program, experience-sharing in groups of 12 GP trainees, offers opportunities to explore these feelings. The format of this experience-sharing (well-defined boundaries, minimal structure, facilitating leaders) often evokes behavior in which the peculiarities of the dependence-making behavior of the GP's vis-a-vis patients are mirrored: that is, dependent behavior. In order to analyze and influence this behavior, use can be made of Levine's model of group psychotherapy, which focuses on enhancing autonomy. In this paper we show, by means of four group cases, how Levine's framework can be used to enhance autonomy, lessen dependence, and thus diminish the tendency of GP's toward dependence-making behavior.  
25461415	Organoarsenicals in poultry litter: detection, fate, and toxicity.	Environment international	2015	train	24	0	0	Organoarsenicals in poultry litter: detection, fate, and toxicity.  Arsenic contamination in groundwater has endangered the health and safety of millions of people around the world. One less studied mechanism for arsenic introduction into the environment is the use of organoarsenicals in animal feed. Four organoarsenicals are commonly employed as feed additives: arsanilic acid, carbarsone, nitarsone, and roxarsone. Organoarsenicals are composed of a phenylarsonic acid molecule with substituted functional groups. This review documents the use of organoarsenicals in the poultry industry, reports analytical methods available for quantifying organic arsenic, discusses the fate and transport of organoarsenicals in environmental systems, and identifies toxicological concerns associated with these chemicals. In reviewing the literature on organoarsenicals, several research needs were highlighted: advanced analytical instrumentation that allows for identification and quantification of organoarsenical degradation products; a greater research emphasis on arsanilic acid, carbarsone, and nitarsone; identification of degradation pathways, products, and kinetics; and testing/development of agricultural wastewater and solid treatment technologies for organoarsenical-laden waste.

Journal of interpersonal violence	2009	train	8	2	1	Depressive symptoms among female college students experiencing gender-based violence in Awassa, Ethiopia.  Little epidemiologic research has focused on the mental health effects of gender-based violence among sub-Saharan African women. The objective of this study was to assess risk of depression and depressive symptoms among 1,102 female undergraduate students who were victims of gender-based violence. Students who reported experience of any gender-based violence were nearly twice as likely to be classified as having moderate depression during the academic year (OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.39-2.82) as compared with nonabused students. Compared with nonabused students, those who had experienced both physical and sexual abuse were 4 times more likely to report either moderately severe (OR = 4.32, 95% CI = 2.00-9.31) or severe depressive symptoms (OR = 4.19, 95% CI = 1.01-17.43). Our findings, consistent with previous studies, support the thesis that women's mental health status is adversely affected by exposure to gender-based violence.  
29868379	The association between long work hours and leisure-time physical activity and obesity.	Preventive medicine reports	2018	train	21	8	6	The association between long work hours and leisure-time physical activity and obesity.  Obesity affects approximately one-third of all U.S. adults, presenting a large economic and public health burden. Long work hours may be contributing to the rising obesity problem by reducing time for physical activity, particularly for individuals working in sedentary occupations. This study sought to investigate the association between long work hours, leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), and obesity across levels of occupational activity in order to identify potentially vulnerable groups. Cross sectional analysis was performed in 2017 using data from the 2015 Georgia Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and prevalence ratios were estimated across work hour and occupational activity groups. Ability to meet guidelines for LTPA did not differ significantly across work hour categories overall. Those working in low activity occupations were more likely to meet aerobic guidelines for LTPA compared to those in intermediate and high activity occupations (chi(2): 19.3; P-value: <0.01). Results of interaction assessment demonstrate that the effects of work hours on obesity risk and meeting aerobic guidelines are significantly different across OA categories, indicating OA to be an effect modifier of the relationship between long work hours and obesity (chi(2): 13.33; P-value: <0.001; chi(2): 4.42; P-value: <0.05). Employees in intermediate activity occupations working long hours were found to be at the greatest risk for obesity. Further research is required to better understand the mechanisms impacting the relationship between long work hours, domains of physical activity, and obesity risk as well as to identify effective intervention and prevention programs for employees in intermediate activity occupations.

Cardiovascular pathology : the official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Pathology	2013	train	7	13	9	Fatal coronary artery intimal hyperplasia due to amphetamine use.  BACKGROUND: Amphetamines have been reported to cause myocardial infarct, cerebral hemorrhage, aortic dissection, hypertension, vasculitis, aneurysms, and, occasionally, death from direct toxicity. To date, there have been no reports of coronary intimal hyperplasia in an amphetamine user. METHODS: A 29-year-old male was found collapsed after jogging. He had been taking amphetamines for 11 years for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Past medical history was positive for mild hypertension and migraine headaches. He underwent a complete autopsy and drug screen. RESULTS: At gross autopsy his left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery was occluded and he had an old myocardial infarct in the anterior wall of the left ventricle. Microscopic findings included occlusive intimal hyperplasia (positive for smooth muscle actin) in the LAD and an old left ventricular anterior wall infarct surrounded by acute infarct. CONCLUSION: In addition to other reported adverse effects, amphetamines can also cause occlusive intimal hyperplasia of the coronary arteries.

International journal of group psychotherapy	2010	train	4	8	0	Group therapy module to enhance self-esteem in patients with borderline personality disorder: a pilot study.  Psychotherapeutic treatments of borderline personality disorder (BPD) often focus on severe behavioral problems. Until now, few techniques have been developed to specifically address low self-esteem in BPD. We developed a 6-session psychoeducative group therapy module to treat low self-esteem in BPD patients. After developing and piloting the therapy module, a controlled outpatient pilot study was performed. Nineteen female BPD patients participated in the group module after discharge from an inpatient DBT program. Twenty-four female BPD patients served as controls. Outcome was assessed by different self-esteem measures. Results showed a greater improvement in self-esteem in the intervention group. The findings suggest that the therapy module is an effective adjunctive treatment in increasing self-esteem in BPD.

Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society	2000	train	3	18	0	Hyperhomocysteinemia in liver transplant recipients: prevalence and multivariate analysis of predisposing factors.  Liver transplant recipients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease because of a high incidence of obesity, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been found to be an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease in large studies. Fasting serum levels of homocysteine were measured in 105 liver transplant recipients, and hyperhomocysteinemia was defined as a fasting serum homocysteine level greater than 13 micromol/L. Patients with versus without hyperhomocysteinemia were compared. The possible association of hyperhomocysteinemia with age, sex, cause of liver disease, time elapsed since liver transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy, folic acid level, liver function test results, renal function, and other cardiovascular risk factors was investigated. Patients with serum homocysteine levels greater than 15 micromol/L were treated with folic acid, 10 mg/d, and serum homocysteine levels were measured again 1 to 3 months later in 10 patients. Hyperhomocysteinemia was detected in 28 patients (27%). In univariate analysis, it was associated with hepatitis C virus infection, treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, and greater serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, urea, and creatinine. In multivariate analysis, only greater serum levels of creatinine (P =.006) were associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. Treatment with folic acid resulted in a decrease in fasting serum homocysteine levels in 9 of the 10 patients tested (P =.01). Hyperhomocystinemia, associated with renal dysfunction, is a frequent finding in liver transplant recipients. Treatment with folic acid may reduce fasting homocysteine levels.  
15967030	Washing our hands of the congenital cytomegalovirus disease epidemic.	BMC public health	2005	train	5	14	5	Washing our hands of the congenital cytomegalovirus disease epidemic.  BACKGROUND: Each year in the United States, an estimated 40,000 children are born with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, causing an estimated 400 deaths and leaving approximately 8000 children with permanent disabilities such as hearing or vision loss, or mental retardation. More children are affected by serious CMV-related disabilities than by several better-known childhood maladies, including Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, and spina bifida. DISCUSSION: Congenital CMV is a prime target for prevention not only because of its substantial disease burden but also because the biology and epidemiology of CMV suggest that there are ways to reduce viral transmission. Because exposure to the saliva or urine of young children is a major cause of CMV infection among pregnant women, it is likely that good personal hygiene, especially hand-washing, can reduce the risk of CMV acquisition. Experts agree that such measures are likely to be efficacious (i.e., they will work if consistently followed) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that physicians counsel pregnant women about preventing CMV acquisition through careful attention to hygiene. However, because of concerns about effectiveness (i.e., Will women consistently follow hygienic practices as the result of interventions?), the medical and public health communities appear reluctant to embrace primary CMV prevention via improved hygienic practices, and educational interventions are rare. Current data on the effectiveness of such measures in preventing CMV infection are promising, but limited. There is strong evidence, however, that educational interventions can prevent other infectious diseases with similar transmission modes, suggesting that effective interventions can also be found for CMV. Until a CMV vaccine becomes available, effective educational interventions are needed to inform women about congenital CMV prevention. SUMMARY: Perhaps no single cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities in the United States currently provides greater opportunity for improved outcomes in more children than congenital CMV. Given the present state of knowledge, women deserve to be informed about how they can reduce their risk of CMV infection during pregnancy, and trials are needed to identify effective educational interventions.  
25253005	[Reconsideration for ischemic stroke risk factors in youth].	Zhonghua yi xue za zhi	2014	train	9	21	5	[Reconsideration for ischemic stroke risk factors in youth].  OBJECTIVE: To explore the related ischemic stroke (IS) risk factors in youth and the importance of sleep quality in young ischemic stroke. METHODS: A total of 219 patients aged 18 to 45 years (166 males, 53 females) with an initial onset of ischemic stroke from First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University and Puyang People's Hospital during June 2011 to February 2013, were recruited as the study cases. Meanwhile 231 patients aged 46 to 80 years (170 males, 61 females) from the same hospitals were selected as the elderly control group. And 149 young persons aged 18 to 45 years undergoing normal physical examinations from the same hospitals were taken as youth control group. For all cases, their ischemic stroke related risk factors and especially the importance of sleep quality were analyzed. Prospective analyses were conducted to re-considerate the related ischemic stroke risk factors in youth. RESULTS: Hypertension history, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking and drinking, bad sleep quality, family history of stroke and hyperhomocysteinemia were associated with the onset of young ischemic stroke. The decreasing exposure rates were history of hypertension, smoking, poor sleep quality, hyperlipidemia, alcoholism, hyperhomocysteinemia and a family history of stroke and diabetes. In ischemic stroke young patients, bad sleep quality accounted for 55.7% and ranked third among all risk factors. CONCLUSION: The risk factors of young ischemic stroke ranks are different with other studies. As one of the most important factors for youth ischemic stroke, poor sleep quality should not be neglected.  
31945102	Income inequalities in stroke incidence and mortality: Trends in stroke-free and stroke-affected life years based on German health insurance data.	PloS one	2020	train	12	15	0	Income inequalities in stroke incidence and mortality: Trends in stroke-free and stroke-affected life years based on German health insurance data.  BACKGROUND: Due to substantial improvements in prevention and therapy, stroke incidence and mortality rates have decreased during the last decades, but evidence is still lacking on whether all socioeconomic groups benefited equally and how the length of life affected by stroke developed over time. Our study investigates time trends in stroke-free life years and life years affected by stroke. Special emphasis is given to the question whether trends differ between income groups, leading to decreasing or increasing social inequalities. METHODS: The analyses are based on claims data of a German statutory health insurance company of the two time periods 2006-2008 and 2014-2016. Income inequalities and time trends in incidence and mortality risks were estimated using multistate survival models. Trends in stroke-free life years and life years affected by stroke are analysed separately for income groups by applying multistate life table analyses. RESULTS: Stroke incidence and mortality risks decreased in men and women in all income groups. While stroke-free lifetime could be gained in men having higher incomes, improvements in mortality counterbalanced decreasing incidences, leading to increases in life years affected by stroke among men of the lower and higher income group. Among women, no significant changes in life years could be observed. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in stroke-affected life years occur among men in all income groups, but are more pronounced in the higher income group. However, irrespective of the income group the proportion of stroke-affected life years remains quite stable over time, pointing towards constant inequalities. Further research is needed on whether impairments due to stroke reduced over time and whether all socioeconomic groups are affected equally.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess differences in exercise counseling preferences, program preferences, and telephone/Internet access among breast cancer survivors based on exercise behavior and demographic, medical, social cognitive, and environmental factors. METHODS: A self-administered survey was returned by 192 breast cancer survivors. RESULTS: Participants were Caucasian (98%), and the mean age was 64+/-11.5 years. Participants preferring an exercise specialist were more likely to report current treatment, higher self-efficacy, greater perceived barriers, and a residential environment conducive to physical activity. Participants preferring face-to-face counseling and exercising outdoors were younger, and those preferring to exercise alone and at home reported lower social support. Low-intensity exercise was preferred by participants who were sedentary, obese, less self-efficacious, enjoyed exercise less, perceived greater barriers, and reported lower social support. Participants with Internet access were more apt to be younger with higher income and greater social support. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic, medical, social cognitive, and environmental factors might influence exercise preferences and Internet access. Future research assessing the effectiveness of tailoring interventions based on these factors is warranted.

Cancer causes & control : CCC	2005	train	20	10	7	Dietary intakes of fruit, vegetables, and fiber, and risk of colorectal cancer in a prospective cohort of women (United States).  OBJECTIVE: Although animal studies suggest an inverse association between consumption of plant foods and risk of colorectal cancer, many observational data have failed to support such an association. We prospectively examined the association between dietary intakes of fruit, vegetables, and fiber and colorectal cancer risk in a large female cohort from the Women's Health Study. METHODS: Among 39,876 healthy women aged >/=45 years at baseline, 36,976 with baseline self-reported information on dietary intakes and other risk factors for colorectal cancer were included in the analyses. During an average follow-up of 10 years, 223 women were diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Intakes of fruit, vegetables, and fiber were assessed by a baseline food-frequency questionnaire. The analyses were carried out using the Cox proportional hazards regression and all tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Intakes of fruit, vegetables, and the specific subgroups were not found to be associated with colorectal cancer risk. Multivariate relative risks (RRs) comparing the highest with lowest quintile were 0.79 (95% CI=0.49-1.27,p for trend =0.30) for fruit intake, and 0.88 (95% CI=0.56-1.38,p for trend=0.30) for vegetables intake. Similarly, intake of total fiber was not associated with colorectal cancer risk; the RR for the highest relative to lowest quintile was 0.75 (95% CI=0.48-1.17,p for trend=0.12). However, higher intake of legume fiber was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer; the RR for the highest versus slowest quintile was 0.60 (95% CI=0.40-0.91,p for trend=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our data offer little support for associations between intakes of fruit, vegetables, and fiber, and colorectal cancer risk. However, our data suggest that legume fiber and/or other related sources may reduce risk of colorectal cancer.

Frontiers in neurology	2013	train	10	13	8	Vascular endothelial growth factor and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels unaltered in symptomatic atherosclerotic carotid plaque patients from north India.  We aimed to identify the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) as a serum biomarker of symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic plaque in North Indian population. Individuals with symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic plaque have high risk of ischemic stroke. Previous studies from western countries have shown an association between VEGF and MCP-1 levels and the incidence of ischemic stroke. In this study, venous blood from 110 human subjects was collected, 57 blood samples of which were obtained from patients with carotid plaques, 38 neurological controls without carotid plaques, and another 15 healthy controls who had no history of serious illness. Serum VEGF and MCP-1 levels were measured using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We also correlated the data clinically and carried out risk factor analysis based on the detailed questionnaire obtained from each patient. For risk factor analysis, a total of 70 symptomatic carotid plaque cases and equal number of age and sex matched healthy controls were analyzed. We found that serum VEGF levels in carotid plaque patients did not show any significant change when compared to either of the controls. Similarly, there was no significant upregulation of MCP-1 in the serum of these patients. The risk factor analysis revealed that hypertension, diabetes, and physical inactivity were the main correlates of carotid atherosclerosis (p < 0.05). Prevalence of patients was higher residing in urban areas as compared to rural region. We also found that patients coming from mountain region were relatively less vulnerable to cerebral atherosclerosis as compared to the ones residing at non mountain region. On the contrary, smoking, obesity, dyslipidemia, alcohol consumption, and tobacco chewing were not observed as the determinants of carotid atherosclerosis risk in North India (p > 0.05). We conclude that the pathogenesis of carotid plaques may progress independent of these inflammatory molecules. In parallel, risk factor analysis indicates hypertension, diabetes, and sedentary lifestyle as the most significant risk factors of ischemic stroke identified in North India. This could be helpful in early identification of subjects at risk for stroke and devising health care strategies.

Current diabetes reviews	2021	train	1	16	0	High Prevalence of Vitamin D Deficiency and Correlation with Cystatin-C and Other Cardiovascular and Renal Risk Biomarkers in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Complicated with Hypertension.  BACKGROUND: Vitamin D is increasingly investigated as having a role in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and its cardiovascular and renal complications. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) and biomarkers of cardiovascular and renal complications, including cystatin-C. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 117 participants with T2DM that was not complicated with cardiovascular or renal diseases except hypertension. 25-OHD was measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, while cystatin-C was measured by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay. Other biomarkers, including lipids, creatinine, urea and glycemic measures, were determined by the routine biochemistry assays. RESULTS: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 74.36%. There was no significant difference in cardiovascular and renal biomarkers, including glucose, HbA1c, lipids, urea, creatinine and cystatin-C between participants with adequate and deficient vitamin D (p-values>0.05). Participants with adequate vitamin D were older in age, more obese and having lower eGFR (p-values<0.05). 25-OHD was weakly correlated with age, duration of DM, urea, creatinine and inversely correlated with eGFR (rvalues< 0.32, p-values<0.05). Although creatinine and cystatin-C were directly correlated (r=0.42, pvalue< 0.001), cystatin-C and 25-OHD were not correlated (p-value>0.05). Hypertensive participants were more obese, having a longer duration of DM and higher urea and cystatin-C compared to nonhypertensive participants (p-values<0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that hypertension could be predicted from increased BMI. CONCLUSION: 25-OHD was not found to be correlated with cardiovascular risk biomarkers, but it was correlated with renal biomarkers, including urea, creatinine and eGFR. Cystatin-C and 25-OHD were not observed to be correlated to each other, but both were correlated to renal function. Obesity was a significant predictor of hypertension.

Environment international	2021	train	7	0	0	Evaluating national and subnational CO2 mitigation goals in China's thirteenth five-year plan from satellite observations.  Good-quality emission data are essential to validate national climate commitments and implement domestic policies. However, conventional bottom-up data collection is costly and subject to potential manipulation by stakeholders when data pass through their hands, which could pose challenges on the efficiency and effectiveness of compliance monitoring especially in developing countries. Satellite observations, specifically OCO-2 XCO2 measurements, are utilized in this study to develop a relatively independent and timely dataset for screening the attainment statuses of national and subnational CO2 mitigation goals in China's 13th Five-Year Plan (FYP, 2016-2020). We establish CO2 emission estimation models at both pixel and provincial levels. As interpolated with the pixel-level model, CO2 emissions of prefecture-level municipalities indicate that approximately three fifth of them had accomplished their individualized FYP mitigation goals by 2019, while our provincial-level estimation suggests that three quarters of provinces had attained theirs. More resources for compliance monitoring could thus be directed to other presumably-unattaining local governments. National aggregate absolute emissions showed 8.0-18.3% reduction in 2019 across three provincial models from the 2015 level, while national CO2 intensity dropped by 28.8-36.8% to imply attaining the 18% reduction goals.

Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology	2016	train	3	11	0	Circulating 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and Prostate Cancer Survival.  BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiologic evidence suggests that higher circulating vitamin D does not protect against prostate cancer and, in fact, may increase the risk of developing this malignancy. However, few studies have examined the most clinically relevant outcome, prostate cancer mortality. METHODS: We examined prediagnostic serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) and prostate cancer survival in a cohort of 1,000 cases in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study. During 23 years of follow-up, 363 men died from their disease. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of death from prostate cancer by season-specific quintile of 25(OH)D. Multivariable models were adjusted for age, physical activity, cigarettes per day, and family history of prostate cancer. RESULTS: Men with higher serum 25(OH)D were less likely to die from their prostate cancer (Q5 vs. Q1 HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52-0.99; Ptrend = 0.006). This finding was independent of stage or grade at diagnosis and appeared restricted to men who survived longer (survived <3.3 years: Q5 vs. Q1 HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.61-1.50; Ptrend, 0.53; survived >=3.3 years: Q5 vs. Q1 HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.34-0.85; Ptrend, 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of men diagnosed with prostate cancer, higher serum 25(OH)D years prior to diagnosis was associated with longer prostate cancer survival. IMPACT: In light of inconsistent evidence regarding the role of vitamin D in the development of prostate cancer, the present findings regarding the most clinically relevant prostate cancer outcome, disease-specific mortality, could have important public health implications.

Generally the number of deaths per million population are higher in the developed countries despite better health care efficiency, drinking water quality and expected healthy life span (HALE) at the time of birth. Developing and underdeveloped countries on the other hand have lower mortality even with higher rural and slum populations along with incidence of diarrhea because of lack of sanitation. We analyzed data from 122 countries out of which 80 were high or upper middle income and 42 were low or low middle income countries. There was statistically significant positive correlation between COVID 19 deaths /million population and water current score, health efficiency, and HALE. Statistically significant negative correlation was observed with % rural population and fraction of diarrhea because of inadequate sanitation for all ages. Moreover analysis of 51 countries showed that there is significant negative correlation between COVID 19 deaths /million population and proportion of total population living in slums. We propose that high microbial exposure particularly gram negative bacteria can possibly induce interferon type I which might have a protective effect against COVID 19 since the countries with less mortality also tend to have lack of sanitation and high incidence of attendant diseases. So, far none of the predictive models have taken into account immune status of populations engendered by environmental microbial exposure or microbiome. There might be a need to look at dynamics of COVID 19 pandemic using immune perspective. The approach can potentially inform better policies including interventions.

Journal of women's health (2002)	2020	train	14	13	3	Sex Differences, Cocaine Use, and Liver Fibrosis Among African Americans in the Miami Adult Studies on HIV Cohort.  Background: HIV infection disproportionally affects African Americans. Liver disease is a major cause of non-HIV morbidity and mortality in this population. Substance abuse accelerates HIV disease and may facilitate progression of liver disease. This study investigated the relationship between sex differences and cocaine use with liver injury, characterized as hepatic fibrosis. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 544 African Americans [369 people living with HIV (PLWH) and 175 HIV seronegative] from the Miami Adult Studies on HIV (MASH) cohort. Cocaine use was determined with a validated self-reported questionnaire and confirmed with urine screen. Fasting blood was used to estimate liver fibrosis using the noninvasive fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index. Results: Men living with HIV had 1.79 times higher odds for liver fibrosis than women living with HIV (p = 0.038). African American women had higher CD4 count (p = 0.001) and lower HIV viral load (p = 0.011) compared to African American men. Fewer women (PLWH and HIV seronegative) smoked cigarettes (p = 0.002), and fewer had hazardous or harmful alcohol use (p < 0.001) than men. Women also had higher body mass index (kg/m(2)) (p < 0.001) compared to men. No significant association was noted among HIV seronegative participants for liver fibrosis by sex differences or cocaine use. Among African Americans living with HIV, cocaine users were 1.68 times more likely to have liver fibrosis than cocaine nonusers (p = 0.044). Conclusions: Sex differences and cocaine use appear to affect liver disease among African Americans living with HIV pointing to the importance of identifying at-risk individuals to improve outcomes of liver disease.

Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology	2017	train	0	0	0	Genetic Influences of OPRM1, OPRD1 and COMT on Morphine Analgesia in a Multi-Modal, Multi-Tissue Human Experimental Pain Model.  Human studies on experimentally induced pain are of value to elucidate the genetic influence on morphine analgesia under controlled conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate whether genetic variants of mu-, kappa- and delta-opioid receptor genes (OPRM1, OPRK1 and OPRD1) and catechol-O-methyltransferase gene (COMT) are associated with the morphine analgesia. The study was a randomized, double-blind, two-way, crossover, single-dose study conducted in 40 healthy participants, where morphine was compared with placebo. Pain was induced by contact heat, muscle pressure, bone pressure, rectal stimulations (mechanical, electrical and thermal) and cold pressor test (immersion of the hand into ice water). Sixteen genetic polymorphisms of four candidate genes were explored. Variability in morphine analgesia to contact heat stimulation was associated with COMT rs4680 (p = 0.04), and rectal thermal stimulation was associated with OPRM1 rs9479757 (p = 0.03). Moreover, in males, variability in morphine analgesia to rectal thermal stimulation was associated with OPRD1 polymorphisms: rs2234918 (p = 0.01) and rs533123 (p = 0.046). The study was explorative and hypothesis-generating due to the relatively small study size. However, results suggest that genetic variants in the COMT and OPRM1 irrespective of gender, and OPRD1 in males may contribute to the variability in morphine analgesia in experimental pain models.

Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the official publication of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics	2016	train	26	15	0	Substance use associated with short sleep duration in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between substance use and short sleep duration in individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, depressive type (SADD). DESIGN: Cross-sectional, retrospective study. SETTING: Urban, suburban, and rural centers across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 2,462 consented, adult individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, depressive type (SADD). Participants included inpatients in acute or chronic care settings as well as outpatients and residents in community dwellings. MEASUREMENTS: Substance use was assessed with 10 questions adopted from well-validated measures (e.g., CAGE questionnaire) for alcohol, marijuana, and illicit drugs. Short sleep duration was defined as <6 hr of self-reported sleep per night. RESULTS: Close to 100% of our sample used nicotine while 83% used substances other than nicotine. More importantly, there was a significant association between substance use and short sleep duration. Interestingly, this association was strongest among African-Americans with schizophrenia or SADD. CONCLUSIONS: Because psychiatric medications often target chemical receptors involved with both sleep and substance use, understanding the association between short sleep duration and substance use in individuals with schizophrenia and SADD is important. Given that the majority of premature deaths in individuals with psychotic illness are due to medical conditions associated with modifiable risk factors, prospective studies designed to examine the effect of short sleep duration on behaviors like substance use should be undertaken. Finally, analyzing genetic and environmental data in a future study might help illuminate the strong association found between short sleep duration and substance use in African-Americans with schizophrenia and SADD.

24326981	The effect of antioxidant vitamins E and C on cognitive performance of the elderly with mild cognitive impairment in Isfahan, Iran: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.	European journal of nutrition	2014	train	12	2	0	The effect of antioxidant vitamins E and C on cognitive performance of the elderly with mild cognitive impairment in Isfahan, Iran: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.  PURPOSE: This study was carried out to investigate the effect of vitamins E and C on cognitive performance among the elderly in Iran. METHODS: About 256 elderly with mild cognitive impairment, aged 60-75 years, received 300 mg of vitamin E plus 400 mg of vitamin C or placebo daily just for 1 year. BACKGROUND: Demographic characteristics, anthropometric variables food consumption, cognitive function by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and some of the oxidative stress biomarkers were examined. RESULTS: Antioxidant supplementation reduced malondialdehyde level (P < 0.001) and raised total antioxidant capacity (P < 0.001) and glutathione (P < 0.01). The serum 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine remained unchanged (P < 0.4). After adjusting for the covariates effects, MMSE scores following 6- (25.88 +/- 0.17) and 12-month antioxidant supplementation (26.8 +/- 0.17) did not differ from control group (25.86 +/- 0.18 and 26.59 +/- 0.18, respectively). CONCLUSION: Despite significant improvement in most of the oxidative stress biomarkers, antioxidants' supplementation was not observed to enhance cognitive performance. A large number of kinetic and/or dynamic factors could be suspected.

American journal of obstetrics and gynecology	2002	train	6	2	0	The association of health literacy with cervical cancer prevention knowledge and health behaviors in a multiethnic cohort of women.  OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to describe the relationship between health literacy, ethnicity, and cervical cancer screening practices and to evaluate physician recognition of low literacy. STUDY DESIGN: We studied a prospective cohort of English-speaking patients > or =18 years (n = 529) in ambulatory women's clinics. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate demographics, health practices and beliefs, and knowledge regarding cervical cancer screening and prevention. Physicians' assessments of patient reading skills were obtained. RESULTS: Low health literacy (<9th grade) was found among 40% of participants. Minority women were half as likely to know the purpose of the Papanicolaou test (9% vs 21%; P <.03) and were significantly more likely to have low literacy levels compared with white women (46% vs 15%; P <.05). Literacy was the only factor independently associated with knowledge related to cervical cancer screening (adjusted odds ratio, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.05-4.80). Physicians detected only 20% of the lowest readers. CONCLUSION: Poor health literacy was a better predictor of cervical cancer screening knowledge than ethnicity or education, yet physicians infrequently recognized low literacy. Improved physician awareness and development of low literacy interventions may improve cervical cancer screening, particularly for the most vulnerable women.  
20799287	Prostate cancer risk and exposure to pesticides in British Columbia farmers.	The Prostate	2011	train	20	9	10	Prostate cancer risk and exposure to pesticides in British Columbia farmers.  BACKGROUND: Several epidemiologic studies have reported an increased risk of prostate cancer among farmers. Our aim was to assess the risk of developing prostate cancer in relation to exposure to specific active compounds in pesticides. METHOD: A case-control approach was used with 1,516 prostate cancer patients and 4,994 age-matched internal controls consisting of all other cancer sites excluding lung cancer and cancers of unknown primary site. Lifetime occupational history was obtained through a self-administered questionnaire and used in conjunction with a job exposure matrix to estimate the participants' lifetime cumulative exposure to approximately 180 active compounds in pesticides. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess prostate cancer risk, adjusting for potential confounding variables and effect modifiers. These include age, ethnicity, alcohol consumption, smoking, education, and proxy respondent. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The significant association between prostate cancer risk and exposure to DDT (OR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.04-2.70 for high exposure), simazine (OR = 1.89; 95% CI: 1.08-3.33 for high exposure), and lindane (OR = 2.02; 95% CI: 1.15-3.55 for high exposure) is in keeping with those previously reported in the literature. We also observed a significant excess risk for several active ingredients that have not been previously reported in the literature such as dichlone, dinoseb amine, malathion, endosulfan, 2,4-D, 2,4-DB, and carbaryl. Some findings in our study were not consistent with those reported in the literature, including captan, dicamba, and diazinon. It is possible that these findings showed a real association and the inconsistencies reflected differences of characteristics between study populations.

Glycemic index of grain amaranth, wheat and rice preparations was studied in non-insulin dependent diabetic subjects. Diets containing 50 g carbohydrate equivalent were given and post-prandial blood glucose estimated at different intervals. Glycemic index calculated for different experimental diets showed that GI of amaranth-wheat composite flour diet (25:75) was the least (65.6%) followed by wheat diet (65.7%), rice diet (69.2%), amaranth-wheat flour 50:50 (75.5%), and popped amaranth in milk (97.3%). Therefore 25:75 combination of amaranth and wheat, wheat and rice can be considered low GI food, 50:50 grain amaranth and wheat medium GI food and popped amaranth and milk combination high GI food.  
8909609	Reduced lung cancer mortality in dairy farmers: is endotoxin exposure the key factor?	American journal of industrial medicine	1996	train	5	9	1	Reduced lung cancer mortality in dairy farmers: is endotoxin exposure the key factor?  From two areas in the Province of Padova, we selected 2,283 male farmers who worked either in cattle raising or in crop/orchard cultivation. There were 422 cohort deaths from 1970 to 1992. Using the regional population as a reference, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on the Poisson distribution. Cancer mortality was significantly reduced among the 1,561 dairy farmers (SMR = 0.65; CI = 0.53-0.81); there was a significant decrease in lung cancer (SMR = 0.49; CI = 0.31-0.74), whereas a significant increase from brain tumors was found (SMR = 2.83; CI = 1.04-6.17). Neither overall cancer mortality nor the lung cancer SMR deviated significantly from unity for the 722 crop/orchard farmers. Among dairy farmers, moreover, lung cancer SMRs showed a significant downward trend across the quartiles of increasing length of work, 0.96 in the first quartile, and 0.48, 0.40, and 0.25 in the second, third, and fourth quartiles, respectively. Moreover, lung cancer risk decreased with increasing farm land area, with SMRs in the quartiles of 0.89, 0.37, 0.41 and 0.19. This decrease cannot be attributed to either a selection (healthy worker effect) or a confounding (lower percentage of smokers) bias. Nor was it due to an artifact introduced by differences in age distribution among the quartiles. Dairy farmers are known to be exposed to higher airborne endotoxin concentrations; reasonably, this cumulative exposure increases further with years of work and area of farm. Endotoxins may have protected the dairy farmers against lung cancer through the tumor necrosis factor produced by alveolar macrophages.  
14606923	Clothing and thermoregulation during exercise.	Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)	2003	train	11	0	0	Clothing and thermoregulation during exercise.  Exercise increases heat production. During exercise in both warm and cold conditions, the major dilemma is the dissipation of the heat produced from muscular activity. The use of clothing generally represents a layer of insulation and as such imposes a barrier to heat transfer and evaporation from the skin surface. In warm environments, additional clothing increases thermal insulation causing more rapid increases in temperature during exercise and imposes a barrier to sweat evaporation. However, clothing can serve a protective function by reducing radiant heat gain and thermal stress. Recent research suggests that neither the inclusion of modest amounts of clothing nor the clothing fabric alter thermoregulation or thermal comfort during exercise in warm conditions. In the cold, most reports do not support an effect of clothing fabric on thermoregulation; however, there are reports demonstrating an effect. Clothing construction does alter thermoregulation during and following exercise in the cold, where fishnet construction offers greater heat dissipation. Future research should include conditions that more closely mimic outdoor conditions, where high work rates, large airflow and high relative humidity can significantly impact thermoregulation.  
32678068	Reducing Anxiety and Anxiety Sensitivity With High-Intensity Interval Training in Adults With Asthma.	Journal of physical activity & health	2020	train	11	15	7	Reducing Anxiety and Anxiety Sensitivity With High-Intensity Interval Training in Adults With Asthma.  BACKGROUND: Low- and moderate-intensity exercise training has been shown to be effective for reducing general anxiety and anxiety sensitivity among adults with asthma. Exercise frequency and intensity have been shown to play an integral role in reducing anxiety sensitivity; however, less is known about the impact of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on anxiety in adults with asthma. METHODS: A 6-week HIIT intervention was conducted with adults with asthma. Participants completed HIIT (10% peak power output for 1 min, 90% peak power output for 1 min, repeated 10 times) 3 times per week on a cycle ergometer. Preintervention and postintervention assessments included the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 and the Body Sensations Questionnaire. RESULTS: Total Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (PRE: 17.9 [11.8]; POST 12.4 [13], P = .002, Cohen d = 0.4, n = 20) and Body Sensations Questionnaire (PRE: 2.4 [1.0]; POST: 2.0 [0.8], P = .007, Cohen d = 0.3) improved from preintervention to postintervention. CONCLUSION: A 6-week HIIT intervention leads to improved anxiety among adults with asthma. Future research should determine the impact of HIIT among adults with asthma with clinical anxiety.  
31143939	Increased creative thinking in narcolepsy.	Brain : a journal of neurology	2019	train	5	14	1	Increased creative thinking in narcolepsy.  Some studies suggest a link between creativity and rapid eye movement sleep. Narcolepsy is characterized by falling asleep directly into rapid eye movement sleep, states of dissociated wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep (cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and lucid dreaming) and a high dream recall frequency. Lucid dreaming (the awareness of dreaming while dreaming) has been correlated with creativity. Given their life-long privileged access to rapid eye movement sleep and dreams, we hypothesized that subjects with narcolepsy may have developed high creative abilities. To test this assumption, 185 subjects with narcolepsy and 126 healthy controls were evaluated for their level of creativity with two questionnaires, the Test of Creative Profile and the Creativity Achievement Questionnaire. Creativity was also objectively tested in 30 controls and 30 subjects with narcolepsy using the Evaluation of Potential Creativity test battery, which measures divergent and convergent modes of creative thinking in the graphic and verbal domains, using concrete and abstract problems. Subjects with narcolepsy obtained higher scores than controls on the Test of Creative Profile (mean +/- standard deviation: 58.9 +/- 9.6 versus 55.1 +/- 10, P = 0.001), in the three creative profiles (Innovative, Imaginative and Researcher) and on the Creative Achievement Questionnaire (10.4 +/- 25.7 versus 6.4 +/- 7.6, P = 0.047). They also performed better than controls on the objective test of creative performance (4.3 +/- 1.5 versus 3.7 +/- 1.4; P = 0.009). Most symptoms of narcolepsy (including sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, lucid dreaming, and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, but not cataplexy) were associated with higher scores on the Test of Creative Profile. These results highlight a higher creative potential in subjects with narcolepsy and further support a role of rapid eye movement sleep in creativity.

Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina	2016	train	19	11	5	Frequency of pain and eating disorders among professional and amateur dancers.  CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE:: The pursuit of perfection can cause anxiety and lead dancers to exceed their physical limits. The aim here was to evaluate the prevalence of pain symptoms and eating disorders among professional and amateur dancers. DESIGN AND SETTING:: Observational cross-sectional study; Curitiba, PR, Brazil. METHODS:: Data on 150 professional and non-professional practitioners of ballet, jazz and street dance were collected through specific questionnaires: Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26), Bulimic Investigatory Test Edinburgh (BITE) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-T-6 (STAI-T-6). RESULTS:: Pain was observed in 58.6% of the sample, equally between professionals and amateurs (P = 0.19). Ballet dancers had more lower-limb pain than the other groups (P = 0.05). EAT-26 showed a tendency towards more eating disorders among the amateurs (P = 0.06). Higher risk of eating disorders was found among ballet dancers (P = 0.004) and jazz practitioners (P = 0.02) than among street dancers. Amateurs had more symptoms on the BITE scale (P < 0.0001), more pain (P = 0.002) and higher anxiety (P < 0.0001). Eating disorders were more common among females (P = 0.01) and singles (P = 0.02). Professionals were more satisfied with their own body image than amateurs (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS:: Pain symptoms were found in almost half of the sample, equally among professionals and amateurs as well as between the three dance styles. Female and singles had more eating disorders. Those with eating disorders had higher levels of pain and anxiety.

The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma	2017	train	12	7	0	Are recreational SCUBA divers with asthma at increased risk?  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Asthma has traditionally been regarded as a contraindication to self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) diving, although large numbers of patients with asthma dive. The aim of the review is to provide an update on current knowledge on potential disease-related hazards in SCUBA divers with asthma. METHODS: Systematic literature review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: Seven studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review (comprising a total of 560 subjects). Five studies reported an increased risk for developing diving-related injuries in divers with asthma, based on case reports (n = 1), case history combined with objective assessment (n = 1), and dives and/or simulated dives (n = 3). The remaining studies (n = 2) were based on self-reported diving habits in divers suffering from asthma, obtained from anonymous questionnaires in diving magazines, reported no diving-related injuries among respondents. CONCLUSION: Due to limited evidence it is difficult to draw valid conclusions, but there are indications that recreational divers with asthma may be at increased risk for diving-related injuries compared to non-asthmatic divers. However, it is of at most importance to obtain further evidence from large-scale, well-designed studies.

Journal of physical activity & health	2008	train	12	0	0	Factors affecting exercise attendance and completion in sedentary older adults: a meta-analytic approach.  BACKGROUND: Many different constructs are used currently in the literature to assess exercise adherence. This study examined whether the same or different variables predict exercise attendance and exercise completion among sedentary older adults. METHODS: Thirty-seven randomized control trials were selected from articles published between 1980 and 2000 that tested exercise interventions for sedentary older adults. Block-entry, weighted, hierarchical meta-regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Different factors predicted attendance and completion. Group-based (P < .05) and resistance exercise (P < .1) predicted higher attendance rates than individual-based and aerobic exercise. In contrast, facility-based exercise was associated with higher completion rates than homebased exercise (P < .1). CONCLUSIONS: Results show that completing a program is not synonymous with good attendance. Program designers need to consider different strategies to boost both of these rates that need to be maximized to best benefit program participants.  
22578889	Sleep duration is associated with dyslipidemia in patients with bipolar disorder in clinical remission.	Journal of affective disorders	2012	train	11	15	2	Sleep duration is associated with dyslipidemia in patients with bipolar disorder in clinical remission.  BACKGROUND: The pathways to increased cardiovascular risk in bipolar disorder include health behaviors, psychosocial stress and long-term medication exposure. However, the evidence that the association between cardiovascular risk factors and bipolar disorder remains significant after controlling for these co-factors suggests that additional important risk factors have yet to be identified. Our hypothesis is that disturbances in the sleep-wake cycle are an important and under-recognized pathway through which affective disorders lead to increased cardiovascular risk. METHODS: In patients with bipolar disorder type 1 in clinical remission, we: 1) explored whether sleep disturbance predicted the endorsement of NCEP ATP-III criteria for dyslipidemia, independent of other lifestyle factors and 2) tested the association between low HDL (NCEP-ATP III) and sleep duration measured with actigraphy over an eight-day period. RESULTS: Median sleep duration is significantly associated with low HDL. The risk of having low HDL increases by 1.23 with every 30 minutes of reduced sleep time. LIMITATIONS: Since sleep patterns in patients with bipolar disorder are variable and irregular, it is possible that other sleep characteristics, not present during the span of our study, or the variability itself may be what drives the increased cardiovascular risk. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep characteristics of patients with bipolar disorder in clinical remission are associated with cardiovascular risk. More specifically, sleep duration was associated with low HDL. Clinicians should pay special attention to sleep hygiene in treating individuals with bipolar disorder, even when they are in clinical remission.  
41697	Progress toward a voluntary oral consumption model of alcoholism.	Drug and alcohol dependence	1979	train	14	1	0	Progress toward a voluntary oral consumption model of alcoholism.  With the goal of obtaining a suitable animal model for voluntary oral consumption of ethanol, the investigators selectively bred lines of alcohol-preferring and alcohol-nonpreferring rats, with preference considered as a function of the concentration of ethanol ingested. Studies with these animals showed that drinking is voluntary and not contingent on caloric restriction; that they will work to obtain ethanol even when food and water are freely available, and in so doing, show psychological or behavioral tolerance; that the amount of ethanol voluntarily consumed approaches their apparent maximum capacity for ethanol elimination. This amount of ethanol was capable of altering brain neurotransmitter content, thus exerting a CNS pharmocologic effect. In addition, the rats will bar-press for intravenous administration of ethanol, and with prolonged, free-choice consumption, ethanol intake increases to as much as 12 g per kg body weight per day without producing behavioral deficits, suggesting the development of tolerance.  
27919198	Occupational sedentariness and breast cancer risk.	Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)	2017	train	15	7	4	Occupational sedentariness and breast cancer risk.  BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have indicated that physical activity reduces the risk of developing breast cancer. More recently, sedentary behavior has been suggested as a risk factor independent of physical activity level. The purpose of the present study was to investigate occupational sedentariness and breast cancer risk in pre- and postmenopausal women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a population-based prospective cohort study (n = 29 524), working history was assessed by a questionnaire between 1990 and 1992. Participants were classified as having: (1) sedentary occupations only; (2) mixed occupations or (3) non-sedentary occupations only. The association between occupational sedentariness and breast cancer incidence was analyzed by Cox regression, adjusted for known risk factors and participation in competitive sports. RESULTS: Women with a working history of occupational sedentariness had a significantly increased risk of breast cancer (adjusted HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.05, 1.37) compared with those with mixed or non-sedentary occupations. The association was stronger among women younger than 55 years (adjusted HR 1.54; 95% CI 1.20, 1.96), whereas no association was seen in women 55 years or older. Adjustment for participation in competitive sports did not change the association. CONCLUSIONS: We found that occupational sedentariness was associated with increased breast cancer risk, especially in women younger than 55 years. This may be a modifiable risk factor by planning breaks during the working day. Whether this reduces the risk of breast cancer needs to be further studied.  
19068318	The Residual Risk Reduction Initiative: a call to action to reduce residual vascular risk in patients with dyslipidemia.	The American journal of cardiology	2008	train	5	15	0	The Residual Risk Reduction Initiative: a call to action to reduce residual vascular risk in patients with dyslipidemia.  Despite achieving targets for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, blood pressure, and glycemia in accordance with current standards of care, patients with dyslipidemia remain at high residual risk of vascular events. Atherogenic dyslipidemia, characterized by elevated triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, often with elevated apolipoprotein B and non-HDL cholesterol, is common in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndrome and contributes to both macrovascular and microvascular residual risk. However, atherogenic dyslipidemia is largely underdiagnosed and undertreated in clinical practice. The Residual Risk Reduction Initiative (R3i) was established to address this highly relevant clinical issue. The aims of this position paper are (1) to highlight evidence that atherogenic dyslipidemia is associated with residual macrovascular and microvascular risk in patients at high risk for CVD, despite current standards of care for dyslipidemia and diabetes; and (2) to recommend therapeutic intervention for reducing this residual vascular risk supported by evidence and expert consensus. Lifestyle modification with nutrition and exercise is an important, effective, and underutilized first step in reducing residual vascular risk. Therapeutic intervention aimed at achievement of all lipid targets is also often required. Combination lipid-modifying therapy, with the addition of niacin, a fibrate, or omega-3 fatty acids to statin therapy, increases the probability of achieving all lipid goals. Outcomes studies are in progress to evaluate whether these combination treatment strategies translate to a clinical benefit greater than that achieved with statins alone. The R3i highlights the need to address with lifestyle and/or pharmacotherapy the high level of residual risk of CVD events and microvascular complications among patients with dyslipidemia receiving therapy for high levels of LDL cholesterol and for diabetes in accordance with current standards of care.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine oral health habits and educational needs of children as reported by their parents or guardians attending a health fair in West Virginia. METHODS: Parents and/or guardians completed a questionnaire about the oral hygiene care, food and beverage consumption of their children. They also demonstrated the amount of toothpaste applied to their children's toothbrush. Toothpaste samples were then weighed. RESULTS: Eighty-seven parents or guardians participated. An average of 0.53 mg of toothpaste was dispensed per brushing, almost double the recommended amount. Most of the parents or guardians (75%) indicated their children had brushed twice the day prior to completing the questionnaire. Only 21% reported that their children's teeth had been flossed. Most children had a limited soda, sweet drinks, and fruit juice intake. CONCLUSIONS: Participants were apparently knowledgeable about prevention, the need to limit sugary beverages, and the importance of brushing twice a day. They were not as knowledgeable about the need for flossing, providing fruits and vegetables to their children, the significance of not skipping a meal, or the appropriate amount of toothpaste use.

American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine	1998	train	25	17	16	Association of cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure with location and histology of lung cancer.  Prior studies have suggested that lung cancers that arise in association with cigarette smoking favor an upper-lobe location while those associated with asbestos exposure favor a lower-lobe location. An excess of adenocarcinomas has also been reported among cases not exposed to cigarette smoke as well as among those exposed to asbestos. However, these studies typically have not adjusted adequately for potential confounders such as the patient's age, sex, race, or family history of cancer. To better examine the effects of cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure on location and histology of lung cancer, we analyzed data from a large case-control study that included 456 patients with stage I or II lung cancer. Patients with upper-lobe tumors tended to have had more exposure to tobacco as assessed by pack-years smoked (54.7 versus 46.2, p = 0.07) and less time since quitting smoking (3.0 versus 5.5 yr, p = 0.05). In contrast to some prior reports, asbestos exposure was also associated with an upper-lobe location of tumor. Among those with upper-lobe tumors, 14.6% had a history of significant asbestos exposure compared with 5.4% of those with lower-lobe tumors (p < 0.01). The relationship between asbestos exposure and upper-lobe location of tumor was also statistically significant whether stratified by smoking or analyzed by multivariable logistic regression modeling. Adenocarcinomas were more likely among those with less exposure to cigarette smoke based on fewer pack-years smoked (41.5 versus 61.8, p = 0.0001) and more time since quitting smoking (5.0 versus 3.0 yr, p = 0.02). The proportion of patients with significant exposure to asbestos was lower among those with adenocarcinomas but was not statistically significant (9.5 versus 15.3%, p = 0.09). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, longer time since smoking exposure remained a significant predictor of adenocarcinomas (p < 0.02), but history of asbestos exposure did not predict tumor histology. Thus, in patients with lung cancer, both cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure histories favor an upper-lobe location of tumor. Longer time since smoking exposure favors adenocarcinomas, but the history of asbestos exposure does not appear to influence the tumor histology.  
31088724	Burden of disease from inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene for selected adverse health outcomes: An updated analysis with a focus on low- and middle-income countries.	International journal of hygiene and environmental health	2019	train	17	8	2	Burden of disease from inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene for selected adverse health outcomes: An updated analysis with a focus on low- and middle-income countries.  BACKGROUND: To develop updated estimates in response to new exposure and exposure-response data of the burden of diarrhoea, respiratory infections, malnutrition, schistosomiasis, malaria, soil-transmitted helminth infections and trachoma from exposure to inadequate drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene behaviours (WASH) with a focus on low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: For each of the analysed diseases, exposure levels with both sufficient global exposure data for 2016 and a matching exposure-response relationship were combined into population-attributable fractions. Attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were estimated for each disease and, for most of the diseases, by country, age and sex group separately for inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene behaviours and for the cluster of risk factors. Uncertainty estimates were computed on the basis of uncertainty surrounding exposure estimates and relative risks. FINDINGS: An estimated 829,000 WASH-attributable deaths and 49.8 million DALYs occurred from diarrhoeal diseases in 2016, equivalent to 60% of all diarrhoeal deaths. In children under 5 years, 297,000 WASH-attributable diarrhoea deaths occurred, representing 5.3% of all deaths in this age group. If the global disease burden from different diseases and several counterfactual exposure distributions was combined it would amount to 1.6 million deaths, representing 2.8% of all deaths, and 104.6 million DALYs in 2016. CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent declines in attributable mortality, inadequate WASH remains an important determinant of global disease burden, especially among young children. These estimates contribute to global monitoring such as for the Sustainable Development Goal indicator on mortality from inadequate WASH.  
9169913	Prospective study of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis in asymptomatic chronic hepatitis B virus carriers.	American journal of epidemiology	1997	train	12	22	5	Prospective study of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis in asymptomatic chronic hepatitis B virus carriers.  The authors conducted a study to assess the importance of underlying liver cirrhosis in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the multifactorial etiology of liver cirrhosis in chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Between November 1980 and May 1990, all male hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers who routinely attended a clinic for asymptomatic HBV carriers at the Liver Unit of Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan, were enrolled in the study (n = 1,506). The authors used this cohort to investigate prospectively for liver cirrhosis and HCC at 6-month intervals by means of ultrasonography and clinical assessment. There were 16 incident cases of HCC and 89 cases of liver cirrhosis (78 of whom were detected during follow-up) identified after an average follow-up of 7.1 years. Subclinical liver cirrhosis diagnosed by ultrasonography was significantly associated with the risk for HCC (multivariate-adjusted relative risk (RR) = 11.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.9-35.8). By multivariate analysis, the significant risk factors found for liver cirrhosis in HBsAg carriers were age, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) carrier status, chronic hepatitis manifested by sustained elevated serum aminotransferase levels for > or = 6 months, cigarette smoking, non-A blood types, and low educational levels. Habitual alcohol drinking was not independently related to liver cirrhosis. However, the risk of liver cirrhosis associated with smoking was more striking among drinkers than nondrinkers (> or = 20 cigarettes/day vs. nonsmokers: drinkers, RR = 9.3, 95% CI 1.1-78.8; nondrinkers, RR = 1.85, 95% CI 0.98-3.51), which suggests a possible modification effect of alcohol drinking on the liver cirrhosis risk of cigarette smoking. The authors observed synergistic effects on liver cirrhosis development for cigarette smoking with HBeAg carrier status and chronic hepatitis.

The Science of the total environment	2021	train	27	7	6	Leaving no stone unturned in light of the COVID-19 faecal-oral hypothesis? A water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) perspective targeting low-income countries.  The human coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic. Social distancing, hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment dominate the current fight against COVID-19. In developing countries, the need for clean water provision, sanitation and hygiene has only received limited attention. The current perspective examines the latest evidence on the occurrence, persistence and faecal-oral transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent causing COVID-19. Evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 proliferate in the human gastrointestinal system, and is shed via faeces. SARS-CoV-2 can survive and remain viable for up to 6 to 9 days on surfaces. Recent wastewater-based epidemiological studies from several countries also detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw wastewaters. Shell disorder analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a rigid outer shell conferring resilience, and a low shell disorder conferring moderate potential for faecal-oral transmission. Taken together, these findings point to potential faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which may partly explain its rapid transmission. Three potential mechanisms may account for SARS-CoV-2 faecal-oral transmission: (1) untreated contaminated drinking water, (2) raw and poorly cooked marine and aquatic foods from contaminated sources, (3) raw wastewater-based vegetatble production systems (e.g., salads) and aquaculture, and (4) vector-mediated transmission from faecal sources to foods, particularly those from open markets and street vending. SARS-CoV-2 faecal-oral transmission could be particularly high in developing countries due to several risk factors, including; (1) poor drinking water, wastewater and sanitation infrastructure, (2) poor hygiene and food handling practices, (3) unhygienic and rudimentary funeral practices, including home burials close to drinking water sources, and (4) poor social security and health care systems with low capacity to cope with disease outbreaks. Hence, clean drinking water provision, proper sanitation, food safety and hygiene could be critical in the current fight against COVID-19. Future research directions on COVID-19 faecal-oral transmission are highlighted.  
27601085	The role of prescription medications in the association of self-reported sleep duration and obesity in U.S. adults, 2007-2012.	Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)	2016	train	8	8	4	The role of prescription medications in the association of self-reported sleep duration and obesity in U.S. adults, 2007-2012.  OBJECTIVE: Previous research has not investigated the role of prescription medication in sleep-obesity associations despite the fact that 56% of U.S. adults take at least one prescription medication. METHODS: Data from n = 16,622 adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2007-2012) were used to examine how the association between obesity and self-reported sleep duration varied by total number of prescription medications used in the past 30 days and by select classes of prescription medications including anxiolytics/sedatives/hypnotics, antidepressants, sleep aids, anticonvulsants, thyroid agents, and metabolic agents. RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses showed a significant inverse linear association of sleep duration and obesity, regardless of the total number of prescription medications individuals were taking. Each additional hour of sleep was associated with a 10% decrease in the odds of obesity. Results suggest that increased sleep duration is associated with lower odds of having obesity overall, even for long-duration sleepers (>=9 h), and this association does not differ for those taking antidepressants, thyroid agents, metabolic agents, and multiple prescription medications. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between sleep duration and obesity was similar among all prescription medication users and nonusers. The potential for a nonlinear association between sleep duration and obesity may be important to examine in some specific prescription medication classes.

Cancer research	1991	train	26	7	6	Effects of type of dietary fat on phorbol ester-elicited tumor promotion and other events in mouse skin.  Based on the biological activity of arachidonic acid metabolites, we hypothesized that alterations in the consumption of linoleic acid, the precursor to arachidonic acid, would result in a modification in tumor development when fed during the tumor promotion stage of the mouse skin initiation-promotion model. The effects of seven different levels of dietary linoleic acid (LA), supplied as corn oil in a 15% fat diet, on the incidence and rate of papilloma and carcinoma development were determined. SENCAR mice were placed on one of the experimental diets, containing 1.0, 3.6, 6.0, 7.9, 9.9, 12.5, or 15.0% corn oil, 1 week after initiation with 10 nmol of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene and 3 weeks prior to the start of twice weekly promotion with 1 micrograms 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). At 15 weeks of TPA treatment there were significant differences in papilloma number among diet groups, such that an inverse correlation (r = 0.92) was observed between tumor number and level of corn oil; the lowest corn oil diet group had an average of 11.7 tumors/mouse, while the highest corn oil group had 5.4 tumors/mouse. However, there was little difference in tumor incidence among diet groups. A general relationship between diet and carcinoma incidence was also found, such that the highest corn oil diet group had the lowest carcinoma incidence. In an experiment performed with DBA/2 mice, the average number of papillomas/mouse at 17 weeks was 4.5 (1.0% corn oil), 5.6 (7.9%) corn oil), and 2.3 (15.0% corn oil). Papilloma incidence was also affected by diet, with a 79% incidence for the 15.0% corn oil and an incidence of 93% for the 1.0% corn oil group. analyses of the fatty acid composition of epidermal phospholipids in mice fed the experimental diets reflected the dietary LA levels, in that an accumulation of phospholipid LA, accompanied by an overall decrease in arachidonic acid, occurred with increasing dietary corn oil. In spite of the high membrane levels of LA, no measurable amount of epidermal conjugated dienes of LA could be detected. Epidermal prostaglandin E2 levels in acetone-treated mice were similar for all diet groups (approximately 3 pg/micrograms DNA). However, 6 h after topical application with 4 micrograms of TPA, prostaglandin E2 levels were elevated 5- to 10-fold; an inverse correlation (P less than 0.05) was seen with increasing dietary LA, although the concordance with decreased phospholipid arachidonic acid was not strong.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)  
19248688	Classical varicose vein surgery in a diverse ethnic community.	The Medical journal of Malaysia	2008	train	4	11	0	Classical varicose vein surgery in a diverse ethnic community.  Chronic venous disorders range from telangiactasia or spider veins to varicose veins, venous swellings, skin changes and venous ulcerations. The aim of this study is to assess outcome of varicose vein surgery in the ethnically diverse population of Penang, Malaysia. This study is a retrospective analysis of patients seen from 1999 to 2004. All patients who presented to the outpatient clinic of our surgical department with saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) and/or saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ) reflux associated with incompetence of the great saphenous vein (GSV) or small saphenous vein (SSV) respectively underwent classical varicose varicose vein surgery. A single surgeon at a single institution performed the surgeries. Data from pre-operative, post-operative and follow-up procedures were recorded in case report forms. A total of 202 cases were treated. Of these, 200 were qualified by the inclusion criteria and follow-ups, with 23 who were treated bilaterally. Of those treated, Chinese comprised 47.5%, Indians 27.0%, Malays 12.5% and foreigners 13.0% (largely Indonesian Chinese, British and Americans). The average age was 52.1 years. Indians had the highest average BMI of 29.2, compared to the Chinese who had the lowest of 24.6. Based on occupation, housewives (43.0%), blue collar workers (19.0%), salespersons (12.0%) and factory workers (9.5%) were among those afflicted with varicose veins. While local Chinese predominated in the business groups (salespersons and food-related workers), the Indians and Malays in this study were mainly factory workers and/or blue collar workers. Symptomatology in descending order of severity included pain in 80.0% of cases, swelling in 65.5%, heaviness in 53.5%, cramps in 53.0%, lipodermatosclerosis in 39.0%, superficial thrombophlebitis in 33.5%, venous ulceration in 32.0%, eczema 22.0% and cellulitis in 12.5% of patients. Post surgery pains dropped to 9.9%, cramps 6.4%, heaviness 5.5% and swelling 5.3% (p<0.0001 in all groups). Indians had the highest rate of venous ulcers (35.2% of all Indians treated) possibly due to their high BMI and low socioeconomic background. In cases of venous ulcers, gram negative infections (49.8%) were more common than gram positive infections at 18.8%. Operative procedures performed included great saphenous vein high ligation in 96.5% of cases, stripping 93.5% and multiple avulsions in 98.5%, saphenous popliteal junction ligation with multiple avulsions in 13.0% and subfascial ligation in 10.5%. Operative complications included induration (40.0% of cases), bruising in 49.5%, pains in 15.0%, paraesthesia in 3.5%, wound infection in 4.0%, deep venous thrombosis in 3.0% and ulcer recurrence in 7.5%. A total of 96.2% of patients treated expressed satisfaction with varicose vein surgery. Late presentations of chronic venous insufficiency, possibly as a result of poor understanding and inadequate education on diet, weight control, use of stockings and change in lifestyle by patients, employers and general practitioners are probably the cause of high rates of severe chronic venous disease especially venous ulcerations in the local community. However, classical varicose vein surgery is widely applicable across diverse ethnicities with a high rate of success.  
34477078	Two Cases of Hidradenitis Suppurativa Treated with Adalimumab at the Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Clinical Hospital Mostar.	Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica : ADC	2021	train	4	40	2	Two Cases of Hidradenitis Suppurativa Treated with Adalimumab at the Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Clinical Hospital Mostar.  Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease primarily affecting apocrine gland-rich areas of the body and presenting with painful nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts, and scarring (1). HS is a defect of the follicular epithelium; some have therefore called for the naming the disease acne inversa instead of hidradenitis suppurativa. The term acne inversa links the pathogenesis to acne and reflects the fact that it is an expression of follicular occlusion in localizations inverse to acne vulgaris (2). HS typically occurs after puberty. Studies have shown that the average onset is in the second or third decades of life (3). One of the most frequently cited risk factors for HS is cigarette smoking. Another significant risk factor for HS is obesity. About one-third of patients with HS have reported a family history of the disease (4). A clinically relevant staging and disease severity assessment is essential for the development of evidence-based treatments. There are several scoring systems for the assessment of disease severity of HS, including Hurley staging, HS Physician's Global Assessment (PGA), the modified Sartorius score (MSS), and the HS Severity Index (HSSI). Each of these assessments has both advantages and limitations in daily practice; there is currently no gold standard (5-8). The Hurley staging system is the simplest and most widely used instrument for HS classification in routine clinical practice. It classifies HS into three stages. HS-PGA is relatively easy to apply and is frequently used to measure clinical improvement in clinical trials of medical treatments (5). The system describes six disease stages, increasing in severity on a scale from 1 to 6 (9). MSS is a more detailed and dynamic classification system based on the counting of individual nodules and fistulas within seven anatomical regions. The system, which was developed by Sartorius et al. and later modified, is the first disease-specific instrument for dynamically measuring clinical severity of HS (10). The treatment of HS includes topical clindamycin, triamcinolone acetonide, clobetasol, topical resorcinol, oral antibiotics, hormonal therapy, oral retinoids, and biologic therapies (11). Biologic therapies are increasingly used in patients who fail to sufficiently respond to antibiotic and hormonal treatments. Adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept have all been tested in the treatment of HS but vary in effectiveness and in how well they have been studied. Subcutaneous weekly adalimumab (160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg each week thereafter) is the only biologic agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) for the treatment of HS, and it is recommended as first-line therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe disease who are intolerant or unresponsive to oral antibiotics (12). The first male patient aged 59 years was referred to our Department with very long history of HS. The first symptoms had been unrecognized and presented as a pilonidal cyst 25 years ago as well as cysts on the intergluteal region treated with multiple surgical interventions and systemic antibiotics. The first hospitalization at our Department was in 2016. In addition to HS, the patient had diabetes mellitus (DM) type II and hypertension. A physical examination showed multiple abscesses, fistulas, and nodules in the axillary, inguinal, perianal, gluteal, and intergluteal regions; Hurley staging: stage II, PGA staging: IV, DLQI: 24 (Figure 1, Figure 2). Microbiological repeated swabs showed numerous bacteria such as Esch.coli, S.aureus, Serratia.spp, Enterococcus spp, St.epidermidis, and Proteus mirabilis. Laboratory tests which included complete blood cell count, biochemistry, serology for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B and C infection together with chest X-rays were all within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasound examination found no abnormalities. Quantiferon test was positive. After the monotherapy with isoniazid, a repeated Quantiferon test two months later was negative. The patient was treated with betadine solution and pus drainage until 2018, when at the Department of Dermatology and Venerology prescribed adalimumab in doses of 80 mg initially, 40 mg x2 on the first day and the day after that, then 80 mg after fifteen days followed by 40 mg every ten days. After 16 weeks of treatment with adalimumab, Hurley staging was II, PGA IV, DLQI 3. The second male patient aged 28 years was referred to our Department with a shorter history: the first symptoms were presented as pilonidal sinus in 2012, after that in 2015 as inflamed nodules and fistulas in the axillary and inguinal regions. In 2018, physical examination showed the same nodules with a more intense character as well as furuncles on the scalp and skin of the back, with Hurley staging stage II, PGA staging III, DLQI 14 (Figure 3, Figure 4). Until the disease was diagnosed, the patient was treated several times with peroral antibiotics, while laboratory tests which included complete blood cell count, biochemistry, serology for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B and C infection together with chest X-rays were all within normal limits with the exception of elevated cholesterol (6.1). Abdominal ultrasound examination found no abnormalities. Quantiferon test was negative. The following therapy was administered during hospitalization: Humira (adalimumab) initial dose 160 mg, a dose of 80 mg after 14 days, and after 7 days 40 mg, in addition to local therapy with 10% resorcinol solution at the location of the skin changes. After 16 weeks of treatment with adalimumab, Hurley staging was II, PGA staging was III, and DLQI index was 3. Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic, recurrent inflammatory and debilitating skin disease of the terminal hair follicle that usually presents after puberty with painful, deep seated, inflamed lesions in the apocrine gland-bearing areas of the body, most commonly the axillary, inguinal, and anogenital region (3). Biological therapies have been increasingly used for patients who failed to sufficiently respond to antibiotics and hormonal treatments. Adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept have all been tested in the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa but vary in effectiveness and in how well they have been studied. Subcutaneous weekly adalimumab (160 mg at week, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg each week thereafter) is the only biologic agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) for the treatment of HS and is recommended as first-line therapy for patients who moderate-to-severe disease and who are intolerant or unresponsive to oral antibiotics (5,12). Treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa remains a considerable challenge and should be individualized according to the state and extent of the disease. Therapeutic options for hidradenitis suppurativa were long restricted to the use of local disinfectants and systemic antibiotics as well as repeated incisions and drainage, which produce only short-term benefits. Our patients showed regression of lesions after sixteen weeks of biological therapy.

American journal of epidemiology	2013	train	8	6	2	Analysis of occupational asbestos exposure and lung cancer mortality using the g formula.  We employed the parametric G formula to analyze lung cancer mortality in a cohort of textile manufacturing workers who were occupationally exposed to asbestos in South Carolina. A total of 3,002 adults with a median age of 24 years at enrollment (58% male, 81% Caucasian) were followed for 117,471 person-years between 1940 and 2001, and 195 lung cancer deaths were observed. Chrysotile asbestos exposure was measured in fiber-years per milliliter of air, and annual occupational exposures were estimated on the basis of detailed work histories. Sixteen percent of person-years involved exposure to asbestos, with a median exposure of 3.30 fiber-years/mL among those exposed. Lung cancer mortality by age 90 years under the observed asbestos exposure was 9.44%. In comparison with observed asbestos exposure, if the facility had operated under the current Occupational Safety and Health Administration asbestos exposure standard of <0.1 fibers/mL, we estimate that the cohort would have experienced 24% less lung cancer mortality by age 90 years (mortality ratio = 0.76, 95% confidence interval: 0.62, 0.94). A further reduction in asbestos exposure to a standard of <0.05 fibers/mL was estimated to have resulted in a minimal additional reduction in lung cancer mortality by age 90 years (mortality ratio = 0.75, 95% confidence interval: 0.61, 0.92).

Ethnicity & disease	2020	train	21	11	7	Association between Income and Obesity in Black Men: The Role of Work-Life Interference.  Obesity rates increase as household income increases among Black men, yet only a few studies have sought to understand this unique association. Scholars have posited that gendered stressors like role strain that are work-related could play a role in obesity among Black men. Work-life interference is a concept that captures the conflict between work life and family/personal life. Work-life interference is associated with obesity-related behaviors but has been understudied in Black men. The aim of this study was to determine the interrelationship between work-life interference, income, and obesity among Black men. Using data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey, the associations between household income and odds of overweight and obesity (measured by body mass index) were assessed using ordinal logit regressions. Multiplicative interaction terms were used to assess the potential moderation of the association between income and log-odds of overweight/obesity by work-life interference. The results of our study demonstrate that work-life interference interacts with income >=400% federal poverty level (FPL) on the log-odds of overweight/obesity (beta=2.10, standard error [se]=.87). Among those who reported work-life interference, Black men who had household income >=400% FPL had higher log-odds of overweight/obesity (beta=1.51, se=.74) compared with those with income <100% FPL. There was no association between income and obesity among Black men who did not report work-life interference. The results suggest that work-life interference plays an important role in the positive association between income and obesity in Black men. Future studies should explicate the obesogenic ways in which work and family/personal life combine among high-income Black men.

These longitudinal studies in older adults targeted mediated relationships between habit and physical activity (PA). In The Netherlands two independent studies were conducted among 1976 (Study 1: Mage = 63.63, SD = 8.66, 30% functional limitations) and 2140 (Study 2: Mage = 62.75, SD = 8.57, 45% functional limitations) adults aged 50 years or older. Cross-lagged panel designs were applied to examine whether habit mediates the relationship between prior and later PA and whether PA simultaneously mediates the relationship between prior and later habit. Data on habit and PA were collected by means of questionnaires at baseline (t0) and at 6 (t1) and 12 (t2) months after baseline measurement. Results of structural equation modeling analyses were not unambiguous. Indications for the existence of both hypothesized mediation effects were found, but no clear, unequivocal pattern appeared. Somewhat more support was found for the PA-habit-PA path than for the habit-PA-habit path. More research is needed to draw more definitive conclusions.

Indoor air	2020	train	15	0	0	A chemical dynamic model for the infiltration of outdoor size-resolved ammonium nitrate aerosols to indoor environments.  In the present study, we developed a chemical dynamic model to describe the infiltration of size-resolved ammonium nitrate aerosols from outdoor to indoor environments. This model considered the penetration factor, deposition rate, and the reversible reaction process, which was quantified by the diffusive molar flux on the surface of ammonium nitrate aerosols depending on indoor temperature, humidity, and concentrations of nitric acid (HNO3 ) and ammonia (NH3 ). To verify the model, we employed a single-particle aerosol mass spectrometer with an automated switching system to simultaneously measure size-resolved outdoor and indoor ammonium nitrate aerosols. Comparisons between the predicted and measured concentrations of these aerosols showed a mean relative error of 4.8 +/- 18.3%. To analyze the sensitivity of model parameters, several parameters were perturbed. This analysis indicated that parameters related to HNO3 were more sensitive than those related to NH3 because the indoor gas phase concentration of NH3 was much higher than that of HNO3 .

Pre-prosthetics, as a part of orthodontic treatment in adults has gained increasing importance during recent years. Through coordinated orthodontic, prosthetic and periodontal treatment plans, patients with partial dentition can be offered further treatment possibilities. Such planning would allow for fixed prosthetic treatment possibilities and the survival of critical teeth. They would provide for better aesthetics and avoid functional disturbances. The aim of the present study was to present reports of patients treated by coordinated work at the Dental School of Hamburg University. In patients with partial dentition, premolars were uprighted and distally moved and molars were extruded to be used as abutments for fixed prosthetic reconstructions. Following trauma, the position of the remaining anterior teeth was improved to provide for optimal aesthetics after prosthetic treatment. Extraction of a subalveolarly fractured tooth is avoided through root extrusion and post-core reconstruction. The results demonstrate the advantages of pre-prosthetic treatment as regards stability, aesthetics and function. With the help of pre-prosthetic orthodontic treatment, complicated treatment situations could be handled more successfully than would have been the case without such treatment.

International journal of hypertension	2018	train	10	22	1	Sedentary Lifestyle and Hypertension in a Periurban Area of Mbarara, South Western Uganda: A Population Based Cross Sectional Survey.  Introduction: Globally, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and diabetes constitute over 50% of the noncommunicable disease (NCD) burden and projections indicate Sub-Saharan Africa will experience a larger burden. Urbanization on the continent is contributing to the change in lifestyle such as diet and physical activity, which may increase the risk for CVDs. There is lack of sufficient data from the African continent on hypertension and its association with sedentary lifestyle. Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study in periurban Uganda among adults aged at least 35 years. We administered questions on diet, physical activity, and smoking. We took anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose. Hypertension was defined as systolic BP > = 140 and/or diastolic BP > = 90 and/or history of hypertension medications. Logistic regression was used to determine the crude and adjusted odds ratios for the factors associated with hypertension. Results: We enrolled 310 participants and 50% were female. The prevalence of systolic hypertension was 24.5%, diastolic hypertension was 31%, obesity was 46%, and diabetes was 9%. Of those with hypertension (n = 76), 53 participants (69.7%) were not aware they had high BP. Sedentary lifestyle was significantly associated with hypertension even after adjusting for age and obesity. Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes and majority of participants with hypertension are not aware. Participants with a sedentary work style should be targeted for prevention and screening.

Spearman correlation and negative binomial regression modelling were used to explore the relationships between climate factors and environmental air pollutants and pneumonia incidence. Spearman correlation shows that pneumonia incidence was positively correlated with humidity and negatively correlated with temperature, NO2, and O3. The regression modelling produced a series of models to predict pneumonia incidence based on information on climate and air quality. The result of the models shows that humidity and PM10 were associated with pneumonia incidence. To better protect the health, public health policy and risk assessment approach for pneumonia incidence should include considerations of the effect of air pollution. This result can be used for further intervention to take care of human health.  
33506709	The association between poor sleep quality and anxiety and depression symptoms in Chinese patients with coronary heart disease.	Psychology, health & medicine	2022	train	15	31	8	The association between poor sleep quality and anxiety and depression symptoms in Chinese patients with coronary heart disease.  Poor sleep quality might be a potentially modifiable predictor of prognosis in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Anxiety and depression symptoms are highly prevalent in these patients. Whether anxiety and depression symptoms are risk factors for poor sleep quality in Chinese patients with CHD is unclear. This study is intended to examine the prevalence of poor sleep quality in Chinese patients with CHD and its associations with anxiety and depression symptoms, and to explore whether sex, obesity and CHD type modify these associations. Three hundred and forty-eight participants were included. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI, >7 was defined as poor sleep quality) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were used to assess sleep quality and psychological symptoms. 47.1% of the participants had poor sleep quality. Logistic regression analysis showed that poor sleep quality was independently associated with anxiety and depression symptoms adjusting for demographic and clinical factors. However, adjusted for anxiety symptoms, poor sleep quality was no longer associated with depression symptoms. Subgroup and interaction analysis showed that poor sleep quality was associated with markedly higher HADS anxiety and depression scores among patients with stable angina than those with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). These findings suggest that poor sleep quality was associated with both anxiety and depression symptoms in Chinese patients with CHD. However, in the case of concurrent anxiety and depression, anxiety was the main related factor of a high prevalence of poor sleep quality. The association between poor sleep quality and psychological symptoms was influenced by CHD type.

Arquivos de gastroenterologia	2008	train	37	15	22	[Weight, educational achievement, basic sanitation, alcoholism, smoking and eating habit in patients with gastric cancer].  BACKGROUND: About 35% of the cancer patients are involved in factors coming from the diet and others like alcohol, smoking, sunlight, chemical agents and infections caused by virus. The stomach cancer is the second cause of cancer in the world with 9.9 % of all diagnosis and about 12.1 % of death cases. AIMS: Evaluate the body weight, educational achievement, basic sanitation, smoking, alcoholism and eating habit among patients with gastric cancer and a control group. METHODS: Seventy patients with gastric cancer were paired with 70 subjects without cancer. Data on the weight and height, educational attainment, basic sanitation, smoking, alcoholism and eating habits of the patients were collected from the clinical records and from interviews. RESULTS: Forty two patients were men, the mean age were 60 years old. The actual weight and body mass index of the patients were smaller when compared to the controls. Within the group of patients with gastric cancer, 21 never attended school, and for those who attended, 55% did not finish the elementary school. Among the patient group, 32.9% of them lived in housing with basic sanitation and 37.1% with electricity, against 68.6% of the controls, and 58.6% of the patients lived in rural area, against only 7.1% of the controls. Among the test group, 65.7% of the patients were smokers, whereas in the control group, 44.3% were smokers. In addition, there was also difference in the duration of smoking habit. Alcoholism was also more frequent in the cancer group (44% vs 19%). Food rich in salt, condiments, nitrates, saturated fat, complex carbohydrates, refined sugar and fried salted food had been more used by gastric cancer patients. CONCLUSION: The patients with gastric cancer presented with: less weight, low quality of life as indicated by lower or no access to basic sanitation, electricity and schooling, lived predominantly in rural area, high incidence of alcohol intake and higher intake of high fat foods and industrialized foods.

Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking	2010	train	3	0	0	Predicting the determinants of users' intentions for using YouTube to share video: moderating gender effects.  This research aims to improve understanding of what motivates individual online users to share their videos on YouTube and whether gender affects those motivations. The work proposes a model based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and social influences theory by conducting a survey of 206 male and 135 female video sharers of YouTube to test this model. The results indicate that perceived ease of use is an important determinant of the intention to use YouTube to share video. All factors from the social influence perspective significantly affect the intention to use YouTube to share video. The results show that differences exist in sharing behavior between female and male users. Female users' intention is strongly influenced by usefulness and social norms, while male users' intention is strongly influenced by interpersonal norms. Based on those findings, implications for theory and practice are discussed.  
24999084	Pollution in the working place and social status: co-factors in lung cancer carcinogenesis.	Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)	2014	train	20	13	8	Pollution in the working place and social status: co-factors in lung cancer carcinogenesis.  INTRODUCTION: Apart from the association with tobacco consumption, other factors of importance for prevention and early diagnosis of lung cancer have received little attention. We present a case-control study focusing on professional exposure to carcinogens and social status. METHODS: A written questionnaire was completed by 551 consecutive patients with lung cancer and 494 patients with large bowel cancer. The groups were balanced regarding gender and age distribution. The questionnaire included data on place of birth, education, smoking history, diet and alcohol intake, body weight and height, occupation, housing conditions and family income. According to standard epidemiological criteria, professional exposure to carcinogens was classified as professions with exposure to confirmed lung cancer carcinogens, professions with exposure to suspected lung cancer carcinogens and other professions. RESULTS: As expected, there were significant differences between the two groups regarding smoking status. While there were no significant differences in educational levels, more immigrants were among patients with lung cancer (17.9% vs 11.6%, p=0.005). On average, lung cancer patients had a lower body mass index (BMI) at 24.77, as compared to 26.14 for large bowel cancer (p=0.000). Lung cancer patients had lower income and poorer housing conditions; the bivariate difference was significant both for income levels (p=0.046) and type of residence (p=0.009). The proportion of patients working in professions with exposures to known carcinogens was 33.5% for lung cancer, and 17.1% for large bowel cancer (p=0.000). In the multivariate analysis, smoking (p=0.000), BMI (p=0.000) and type of occupation (p=0.001) were significant factors. CONCLUSIONS: While there is no doubt about smoking in lung cancer carcinogenesis, professional exposure to carcinogens and belonging to lower socio-economic strata also play an important role.  
26315001	Cocaine use as an independent predictor of seizures after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.	Journal of neurosurgery	2016	train	11	37	6	"Cocaine use as an independent predictor of seizures after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  OBJECTIVE: Seizures are relatively common after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Seizure prophylaxis is controversial and is often based on risk stratification; middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms, associated intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), poor neurological grade, increased clot thickness, and cerebral infarction are considered highest risk for seizures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of recent cocaine use on seizure incidence following aSAH. METHODS: Prospectively collected data from aSAH patients admitted to 2 institutional neuroscience critical care units between 1991 and 2009 were reviewed. The authors analyzed factors that potentially affected the incidence of seizures, including patient demographic characteristics, poor clinical grade (Hunt and Hess Grade IV or V), medical comorbidities, associated ICH, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), hydrocephalus, aneurysm location, surgical clipping and cocaine use. They further studied the impact of these factors on ""early"" and ""late"" seizures (defined, respectively, as occurring before and after clipping/coiling). RESULTS: Of 1134 aSAH patients studied, 182 (16%) had seizures; 81 patients (7.1%) had early and 127 (11.2%) late seizures, with 26 having both. The seizure rate was significantly higher in cocaine users (37 [26%] of 142 patients) than in non-cocaine users (151 [15.2%] of 992 patients, p = 0.001). Eighteen cocaine-positive patients (12.7%) had early seizures compared with 6.6% of cocaine-negative patients (p = 0.003); 27 cocaine users (19%) had late seizures compared with 10.5% non-cocaine users (p = 0.001). Factors that showed a significant association with increased risk for seizure (early or late) on univariate analysis included younger age (< 40 years) (p = 0.009), poor clinical grade (p = 0.029), associated ICH (p = 0.007), and MCA aneurysm location (p < 0.001); surgical clipping was associated with late seizures (p = 0.004). Following multivariate analysis, age < 40 years (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.355-3.058, p = 0.001), poor clinical grade (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.124-2.336, p = 0.01), ICH (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.164-3.273, p = 0.011), MCA aneurysm location (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.237-4.854, p < 0.001), and cocaine use (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.330-3.175, p = 0.001) independently predicted seizures. CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine use confers a higher seizure risk following aSAH and should be considered during risk stratification for seizure prophylaxis and close neuromonitoring.  "

The European journal of contraception & reproductive health care : the official journal of the European Society of Contraception	2020	train	7	0	0	Sexual function changes attributed to hormonal contraception use - a qualitative study of women experiencing negative effects.  Objective: To increase the understanding of women who experience negative effects on sexual function when using hormonal contraception.Methods: We performed 24 in-depth interviews with women who had previously experienced negative sexual function effects while using hormonal contraceptives. The thematic analysis method was used.Results: 'After experience comes insight', 'Lubrication and desire go hand in hand', 'Mental wellbeing comes before desire' and 'The contraceptive counsellor potentially facilitates insight and decision-making' were the main themes found in the study.Conclusions: This selected group of women described lubrication difficulties and decreased sexual desire associated with both contraceptive use and the menstrual cycle. Contraceptive use became easier with age and with better understanding. The contraceptive counsellor could facilitate the process. Further choice between hormonal or non-hormonal contraceptive methods depended primarily on experienced adverse effects on mood, and secondarily on sexual function, weighed against the advantages or disadvantages experienced during the person's own menstrual cycle.

The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry	2016	train	0	7	0	Agitation in Alzheimer Disease as a Qualifying Condition for Medical Marijuana in the United States.  OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which states and localities include dementia as a qualifying condition for medical marijuana and how common this indication is. METHODS: The authors reviewed authorizing legislation and medical marijuana program websites and annual reports for the states and localities where medical marijuana is legal. RESULTS: Of the 24 states and localities where medical marijuana is legal, dementia is a qualifying condition in 10 (41.7%), primarily for agitation of Alzheimer disease. In the five states where information was available regarding qualifying conditions for certification, dementia was the indication for <0.5% of medical marijuana certifications. CONCLUSION: Dementia is somewhat commonly listed as a potential qualifying condition for medical marijuana. Currently, few applicants for medical marijuana list dementia as the reason for seeking certification. However, given increasingly open attitudes toward recreational and medical marijuana use, providers should be aware that dementia is a potential indication for licensing, despite lack of evidence for its efficacy.  
27840505	Lifestyle Determinants on Prevention and Improvement of Dry Eye Disease from the Perspective of Iranian Traditional Medicine.	Iranian journal of medical sciences	2016	train	13	8	8	Lifestyle Determinants on Prevention and Improvement of Dry Eye Disease from the Perspective of Iranian Traditional Medicine.  BACKGROUND: Dry eye disease is one of the most common public health problems in the field of ophthalmology that causes decreased physical, psychological, social and occupational functioning, and interferes with daily activities like reading, driving, computer work and watching TV. The effect of this disease on quality of life is similar to severe migraine and angina. In addition, the severity of the disease is closely related to depression. Outbreaks are increasing with the use of contact lenses and refractive surgery such as LASIK. The purpose of this paper is to assess the causes of dry eye and its prevention by the principles of hygiene. METHODS: In this review study, traditional medicine resources like Al canon fil tibb, Sharh-al-Al Asbab and Exir-e-azam have been studied with engine motors such as Google Scholar and PubMed. RESULTS: From the perspective of Iranian traditional medicine, the principles of maintaining health include air, food and drink, exercise and rest, sleep and wakefulness, mental state, retention of essential materials and depletion of wastes from the body. Proper performance of each principle is useful for the prevention of disease in different organs, including the eyes. Recommendations for the prevention or treatment of dry eye disease include the prevention of dryness in the eye or the entire body. In addition, the stomach and brain are important to eye health. Accordingly, one of the most effective managements of dry eye disease is avoiding foods that affect the eye in this way; for example garlic and onion. CONCLUSION: Maintaining eye health is related to aspects of physical and mental health of the whole body. Therefore, codification of an integrated plan that contains eating and sleeping patterns, exercise, general clearing, eye clearing, and mental health is essential for treating dry eye disease.  
5531341	The effect of thyroid hormones on the action of some centrally acting drugs.	British journal of pharmacology	1970	train	19	6	1	The effect of thyroid hormones on the action of some centrally acting drugs.  1. The effect of administration of thyroxine or thyroidectomy on the pharmacological action of (+)-amphetamine, caffeine, hexobarbitone and morphine was determined in rats or mice.2. Locomotor activity induced by (+)-amphetamine or caffeine was increased by hyperthyroidism and decreased by hypothyroidism.3. The LD50s of (+)-amphetamine and caffeine in hyperthyroid rats were 1/30 and 2/5 that of control rats. With each drug, the LD50 regression lines in hyperthyroid and control rats were not parallel, suggesting that hyperthyroidism modifies the mechanism of the toxic effects. Hypothyroidism reduced toxicity to (+)-amphetamine.4. Hexobarbitone sleeping time was prolonged in hyperthyroid male rats, but was shortened in hyperthyroid female rats. In control rats, sleeping time was approximately four times as long in females as it was in males. Ethinyloestradiol treatment and castration also prolonged sleeping time in male rats. No further prolongation was produced by combined administration of thyroxine and ethinyloestradiol, but thyroxine further prolonged the sleeping time of castrated rats indicating that its mode of action in producing these changes is not mediated via sex hormones.5. In contrast to rats, a sex difference in the duration of action of hexobarbitone was not found in mice. Thyroxine prolonged sleeping time equally in each sex.6. Analgesia induced by morphine in mice was unaffected by hyperthyroidism. No increase in sedative or ;Straub tail' activity could be detected, but toxicity was increased when higher doses of morphine were used.7. The mechanism by which thyroid hormones produce these changes in sensitivity to centrally acting drugs is discussed. It is suggested that the effects of thyroxine vary according to whether the mode of action of the drug or its metabolism is modified.  
10607215	Implementation of napping in industry and the problem of sleep inertia.	Journal of sleep research	1995	train	16	0	0	Implementation of napping in industry and the problem of sleep inertia.  It seems reasonable to believe that in specific situations napping at the work place would be possible and used if authorized and encouraged. Very short naps could have very positive long-term effects on biological functions. Training someone to sleep for short periods appears feasible if there is a high motivation to do so. Sleep inertia can be considered as one of the main limiting factors in napping strategy. Sleep inertia depends on different factors such as sleep stage preceding the awakening, temporal placement of the nap, duration of nap and wakefulness preceding it, etc. The effects of sleep inertia might be different depending on the type of task, and a reactivation technique applied immediately after awakening may remove it. Despite the fact that its implementation in industry raises some practical issues, napping can be considered as a possible strategy to increase the vigilance level of night workers.  
17905137	Endocrine disruptors and hypospadias: role of genistein and the fungicide vinclozolin.	Urology	2007	train	29	10	7	Endocrine disruptors and hypospadias: role of genistein and the fungicide vinclozolin.  OBJECTIVES: The phytoestrogen (plant estrogen) genistein, present in soy products, is of interest because in utero exposure to genistein can cause hypospadias in our mouse model and maternal consumption of soy is prevalent in human populations. Another compound of interest is the fungicide vinclozolin, which also causes hypospadias in the mouse and rat and can occur concurrently with genistein in the diet as a residue on exposed foods. A study in the United Kingdom found no relationship between a maternal organic vegetarian diet and hypospadias frequency, but women who consumed nonorganic vegetarian diets had a greater percentage of sons with hypospadias. Because nonorganic diets can include residues of pesticides such as vinclozolin, we sought to assess the interaction of realistic daily exposures to genistein and vinclozolin and their effects on the incidence of hypospadias. METHODS: Pregnant mice were fed a soy-free diet and orally gavaged from gestational days 13 to 17 with 0.17 mg/kg/day of genistein, 10 mg/kg/day of vinclozolin, or genistein and vinclozolin together at the same doses, all in 100 microL of corn oil. The controls received the corn oil vehicle. The male fetuses were examined at gestational day 19 for hypospadias, both macroscopically and histologically. RESULTS: We identified no hypospadias in the corn oil group. The incidence of hypospadias was 25% with genistein alone, 42% with vinclozolin alone, and 41% with genistein and vinclozolin together. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the idea that exposure to these compounds during gestation could contribute to the development of hypospadias.  
28926373	Exposure to Mobile Source Air Pollution in Early-life and Childhood Asthma Incidence: The Kaiser Air Pollution and Pediatric Asthma Study.	Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)	2018	train	13	8	4	Exposure to Mobile Source Air Pollution in Early-life and Childhood Asthma Incidence: The Kaiser Air Pollution and Pediatric Asthma Study.  BACKGROUND: Early-life exposure to traffic-related air pollution exacerbates childhood asthma, but it is unclear what role it plays in asthma development. METHODS: The association between exposure to primary mobile source pollutants during pregnancy and during infancy and asthma incidence by ages 2 through 6 was examined in the Kaiser Air Pollution and Pediatric Asthma Study, a racially diverse birth cohort of 24,608 children born between 2000 and 2010 and insured by Kaiser Permanente Georgia. We estimated concentrations of mobile source fine particulate matter (PM2.5, microg/m), nitrogen oxides (NOX, ppb), and carbon monoxide (CO, ppm) at the maternal and child residence using a Research LINE source dispersion model for near-surface releases. Asthma was defined using diagnoses and medication dispensings from medical records. We used binomial generalized linear regression to model the impact of exposure continuously and by quintiles on asthma risk. RESULTS: Controlling for covariates and modeling log-transformed exposure, a 2.7-fold increase in first year of life PM2.5 was associated with an absolute 4.1% (95% confidence interval, 1.6%, 6.6%) increase in risk of asthma by age 5. Quintile analysis showed an increase in risk from the first to second quintile, but similar risk across quintiles 2-5. Risk differences increased with follow-up age. Results were similar for NOX and CO and for exposure during pregnancy and the first year of life owing to high correlation. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide limited evidence for an association of early-life mobile source air pollution with childhood asthma incidence with a steeper concentration-response relationship observed at lower levels of exposure.

Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (1995)	1998	train	7	0	0	"Particulate emission rates for unpaved shoulders along a paved road.  This paper reports the first empirical estimate of particle emissions from unpaved shoulders along paved roads. Its objectives are to develop and demonstrate an emission rate measurement methodology that can be applied in different areas; identify the mechanisms that suspend dust from unpaved shoulders and the observables related to this suspension process; and quantify PM10 mass emissions in the form of an emission rate. To achieve these objectives, fast-response observations from nephelometers and a sonic anemometer were used to characterize short-lived dust plumes generated by passing vehicles. In addition, detailed soil surface measurements determined the mechanical properties of the shoulder surfaces. Large traffic-induced turbulence events that led to significant dust entrainment were almost exclusively caused by ""large"" vehicles such as trucks, semis, and vehicles pulling trailers, all traveling 50-65 mph. PM10 emission rates for these large, fast-traveling vehicles were determined to be 8 +/- 4 grams per vehicle kilometer traveled under dry conditions. Emissions due to smaller vehicles such as cars, vans, and sport utility vehicles were negligible for normal on-road driving. These results indicate that the majority of PM10 emissions from unpaved shoulders is caused by relatively few vehicles.  "
9813737	[Pathogenesis and epidemiology of arterial hypertension].	Drugs	1998	train	9	20	2	[Pathogenesis and epidemiology of arterial hypertension].  The pathogenesis of arterial hypertension is more clearly understood today because of the availability of data enabling identification of a certain number of precipitating factors. From a genetic standpoint, hypertension would appear to be a multifactorial polygenic disorder with a tendency to interact with certain environmental factors. The latter are mainly related to lifestyle and are potentially modifiable. Obesity during childhood and adolescence is the main predictive factor for hypertension. It has been suggested that the underlying mechanism could well be hyperinsulinaemia, which induces hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. The mechanisms of the relationship between hypertension and alcohol are still unclear. However, in many countries, excessive alcohol consumption has been reported to be a significant factor in the development of arterial hypertension. The negative effect of a sedentary lifestyle on blood pressure has been widely demonstrated. In addition, it has also been shown that regular physical exercise under aerobic conditions leads to a reduction in blood pressure levels. An excessive sodium intake is also responsible for inducing arterial hypertension through increases in cardiac output and effects on vascular reactivity and contractility. Similarly, restricting sodium intake leads to a reduction in blood pressure levels. Smoking--namely, certain components of tobacco smoke--would appear to have both short and long term effects on blood pressure. These contributing factors all have specific effects on cardiac output and peripheral resistance in individuals. At the community level, the impact of hypertension is particularly significant. Prevalence is strongly influenced by the type of population studied, although it is generally estimated that this disease affects between 10 and 20% of the adult population and is responsible for 5.8% of all deaths worldwide. The direct and indirect costs of the disease are particularly high and are generally considered to be underestimated since a significant proportion of cardiac disease and stroke should also be included in any cost estimates, giving extremely high final figures. Hypertension-related morbidity and mortality principally result from cardiovascular complications and approximately 35% of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events can be attributed to hypertension. The highest risks are associated with stroke (relative risk: 3.8) and congestive heart failure in individuals with hypertension, in whom the risk is quadrupled. With regard to risk for an individual, the higher the blood pressure the greater the risk for the patient. However, the situation is very different if the entire population is being considered. In this instance, the highest risk is associated with mild hypertension since this involves the largest proportion of the hypertensive population. Similarly, relative risk corresponds to a probability rate that applies to populations rather than individuals. In response to this contradiction, the concept of absolute risk was proposed and corresponds to the prevalence of the disease. The approach to hypertension treatment based on absolute risk has recently been proposed for use in clinical practice. It takes into account lesions of the target organ together with any other risk factors and thus integrates the notion of prevention which remains the principal approach to the problems encountered in the management of hypertension.  
25009076	Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody in patients with wood-smoke-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without rheumatoid arthritis.	Rheumatology international	2015	train	15	17	10	Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody in patients with wood-smoke-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without rheumatoid arthritis.  Citrullination, a post-translational modification of proteins, is increased in inflammatory processes and is known to occur in smokers. It can induce anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies, the most specific serologic marker for rheumatoid arthritis. Thus far, the incidence of autoimmunity in patients with wood-smoke-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) resulting in anti-CCP production has not been examined. We hypothesise that anti-CCP antibody level in these patients should be higher than that in healthy subjects. A total of 112 non-rheumatoid arthritis patients, including 56 patients with wood-smoke-induced COPD and 56 patients with tobacco-induced COPD, and 56 healthy non-smoker controls were included. The serum anti-CCP antibody levels were measured and compared between the groups and against smoke exposure and clinical characteristics. The mean anti-CCP antibody levels in wood-smoke-induced COPD group were significantly higher than those in tobacco-induced COPD group (p = 0.03) and controls (p = 0.004). Furthermore, 8 (14.2 %) patients with wood-smoke-induced COPD, 4 (7.14 %) with tobacco-induced COPD and 2 (3.57 %) controls exceeded the conventional cut-off of anti-CCP antibody positivity. No relationship was found between the anti-CCP antibody level and age, gender, duration of disease, Pack-years of smoking, and duration of exposure to wood smoke. Moreover, correlations between anti-CCP antibodies and severity of airflow limitation, CAT scores, mMRC scores of dyspnoea, and GOLD staging of COPD severity were not significant. Wood-smoke-induced COPD could significantly increase the anti-CCP antibody level in non-rheumatoid arthritis patients when compared with that in patients with tobacco-induced COPD and healthy controls.  
17159585	Factors distinguishing employed from unemployed people in the Positive Health Study.	AIDS (London, England)	2007	train	13	12	2	Factors distinguishing employed from unemployed people in the Positive Health Study.  OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of unemployment among Australian people living with HIV/AIDS. DESIGN: A longitudinal cohort of Australian men living with HIV/AIDS. METHODS: Participants were separated into two groups, currently working versus currently unemployed. The two groups were compared on a range of factors related to physical health, mental health and sociodemographic variables. Each family of variables was reduced to a set of best predictors, and multivariate log binomial regression was used to identify the predictors of unemployment. RESULTS: Unemployment was more likely among those who experienced HIV/AIDS-related illness, scored higher on the Kessler scale of psychological distress and were older. There was a lower likelihood of unemployment among those who had better self-rated health, had been living with HIV/AIDS for a shorter period and who had a tertiary education. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that unemployment among people living with HIV/AIDS is best understood within a combined social and medical context. Interventions that acknowledge the differences in age and education that contribute to unemployment would improve employment prospects among people living with HIV/AIDS.

Findings are discussed, and the importance of ruptures in working alliance for therapeutic change is emphasized.  "
33271861	Hand Hygiene Behaviors in a Representative Sample of Polish Adolescents in Regions Stratified by COVID-19 Morbidity and by Confounding Variables (PLACE-19 Study): Is There Any Association?	Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)	2020	train	22	9	3	Hand Hygiene Behaviors in a Representative Sample of Polish Adolescents in Regions Stratified by COVID-19 Morbidity and by Confounding Variables (PLACE-19 Study): Is There Any Association?  The hand hygiene may possibly influence the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the multifactorial influence on hand hygiene knowledge and behaviors is proven. The aim of the study was to analyze hand hygiene behaviors in a national representative sample of Polish adolescents in regions stratified by COVID-19 morbidity, while taking socioeconomic status of the region, as well rural or urban environment, into account as possible interfering factors. The study was conducted Polish Adolescents' COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study population (n = 2323) that was recruited based on a random sampling of schools, while the pair-matching procedure was applied within schools and age, in order to obtain adequate number of boys and girls, representative for the general Polish population (n = 1222). The participants were asked about their handwashing habits while using Handwashing Habits Questionnaire (HHQ) and about applied procedure of washing hands. The results were compared in subgroups that were stratified by region for COVID-19 morbidity, socioeconomic status of the region, and rural/urban environment. In regions of low COVID-19 morbidity, a higher share of adolescents, than in regions of high morbidity, declared washing their hands before meals (p = 0.0196), after meals (p = 0.0041), after preparing meals (p = 0.0297), before using the restroom (p = 0.0068), after using the restroom (p = 0.0014), after combing their hair (p = 0.0298), after handshaking (p = 0.0373), after touching animals (p = 0.0007), after contacting babies (p = 0.0278), after blowing nose (p = 0.0435), after touching sick people (p = 0.0351), and after cleaning home (p = 0.0234). For the assessed steps of the handwashing procedure, in regions of low COVID-19 morbidity, a higher share of adolescents included them to their daily handwashing, than in regions of high morbidity, that was stated for removing watch and bracelets (p = 0.0052), removing rings (p = 0.0318), and drying hands with towel (p = 0.0031). For the comparison in regions stratified by Gross Domestic Product, the differences were only minor and inconsistent. For the comparison in place of residence stratified by number of residents in city, there were some minor differences indicating better hand hygiene behaviors in the case of villages and small towns when compared with medium and large cities (p < 0.05). It may be concluded that, in a population-based sample of Polish adolescents, individuals from regions of low COVID-19 morbidity presented more beneficial hand hygiene habits than those from regions of high COVID-19 morbidity.  
29551329	Air Quality Awareness Among U.S. Adults With Respiratory and Heart Disease.	American journal of preventive medicine	2018	train	12	13	3	Air Quality Awareness Among U.S. Adults With Respiratory and Heart Disease.  INTRODUCTION: Poor air quality affects respiratory and cardiovascular health. Information about health risks associated with outdoor air quality is communicated to the public using air quality alerts. This study was conducted to assess associations of existing respiratory and heart disease with three aspects of air quality awareness: awareness of air quality alerts, discussing with a health professional strategies to reduce air pollution exposure, and avoiding busy roads to reduce air pollution exposure when walking, biking, or exercising outdoors. METHODS: During 2014-2016, a total of 12,599 U.S. adults participated in summer waves of the ConsumerStyles surveys and self-reported asthma, emphysema/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, and each aspect of air quality awareness. In 2017, associations between each health condition and air quality awareness were estimated using log binomial and multinomial regression. RESULTS: Overall, 49% of respondents were aware of air quality alerts, 3% discussed with a health professional strategies to reduce air pollution exposure, and 27% always/usually avoided busy roads to reduce air pollution exposure. Asthma was associated with increased prevalence of awareness of air quality alerts (prevalence ratio=1.11, 95% CI=1.04, 1.20), discussing with a health professional (prevalence ratio=4.88, 95% CI=3.74, 6.37), and always/usually avoiding busy roads to reduce air pollution exposure (prevalence ratio=1.13, 95% CI=1.01, 1.27). Heart disease was not associated with air quality awareness. CONCLUSIONS: Existing respiratory disease, but not heart disease, was associated with increased air quality awareness. These findings reveal important opportunities to raise awareness of air quality alerts and behavior changes aimed at reducing air pollution exposure among adults at risk of exacerbating respiratory and heart diseases.  
32240017	Exercise and physical activity in cirrhosis: opportunities or perils.	Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)	2020	train	17	11	0	Exercise and physical activity in cirrhosis: opportunities or perils.  Reduced exercise capacity and impaired physical performance are observed in nearly all patients with liver cirrhosis. Physical activity and exercise are physiological anabolic stimuli that can reverse dysregulated protein homeostasis or proteostasis and potentially increase muscle mass and contractile function in healthy subjects. Cirrhosis is a state of anabolic resistance, and unlike the beneficial responses to exercise reported in physiological states, there are few systematic studies evaluating the response to exercise in cirrhosis. Hyperammonemia is a mediator of the liver-muscle axis with net skeletal muscle ammonia uptake in cirrhosis causing signaling perturbations, mitochondrial dysfunction with decreased ATP content, modifications of contractile proteins, and impaired ribosomal function, all of which contribute to anabolic resistance in cirrhosis and have the potential to impair the beneficial responses to exercise. English language-publications in peer-reviewed journals that specifically evaluated the impact of exercise in cirrhosis were reviewed. Most studies evaluated responses to endurance exercise, and readouts included peak or maximum oxygen utilization, grip strength, and functional capacity. Endurance exercise for up to 12 wk is clinically tolerated in well-compensated cirrhosis. Data on the safety of resistance exercise are conflicting. Nutritional supplements enhance the benefits of exercise in healthy subjects but have not been evaluated in cirrhosis. Whether the beneficial physiological responses with endurance exercise and increase in muscle mass with resistance exercise that occur in healthy subjects also occur in cirrhotics is not known. Specific organ-system responses, changes in body composition, or improved long-term clinical outcomes with exercise in cirrhosis need evaluation.

Sleep medicine reviews	2021	train	8	9	6	Polysomnographic nighttime features of narcolepsy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.  Polysomnographic studies have been conducted to explore nighttime sleep features in narcolepsy, but their relationship to narcolepsy is still imperfectly understood. We conducted a systematic review of the literature exploring polysomnographic differences between narcolepsy patients and healthy controls (HCs) in EMBASE, MEDLINE, All EBM databases, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. 108 studies were identified for this review, 105 of which were used for meta-analysis. Meta-analyses revealed significant reductions in sleep latency, sleep efficiency, slow wave sleep percentage, rapid eye movement sleep (REM) latency, cyclic alternating pattern rate, and increases in total sleep time, wake time after sleep onset (WASO), awakening numbers (AWN) per hour, stage shift (SS) per hour, N1 percentage, apnea hypopnea index, and periodic limb movement index in narcolepsy patients compared with HCs. Furthermore, narcolepsy type 1 patients showed more disturbed nighttime sleep compared with narcolepsy type 2 patients. Children and adolescent narcolepsy patients show increased WASO, AWN, and SS compared with adult patients. Macro- and micro-structurally, our study suggests that narcolepsy patients have poor nighttime sleep. Sex, age, body mass index, disease duration, disease type, medication status, and adaptation night are demographic, clinical and methodological factors that contribute to heterogeneity between studies.

European journal of nutrition	2009	train	5	0	0	Effects of high-AGE beverage on RAGE and VEGF expressions in the liver and kidneys.  BACKGROUND: The formation and accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) increase in some lifestyle-related diseases as well as in aging; however, little is known about the relationship between food-derived AGEs and the pathology of such diseases. AIM OF THE STUDY AND METHODS: To explore whether food items containing high levels of AGEs are involved in the development of lifestyle-related diseases, rats were orally administered a commercial high-AGE beverage [Lactobacillus beverage-A (LB-A)]. With a particular focus on angiogenesis-associated diseases, the gene expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) were examined in the liver and kidneys using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, AGE deposition was immunohistochemically investigated in these tissues. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic VEGF expression was significantly increased in rats administered LB-A (P < 0.01 vs. control). Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis detected glucose-derived AGE-positive cells in the liver from the LB-A group. These results suggest that AGE-rich beverages increase hepatic VEGF expression and AGE accumulation, bringing about early events associated with lifestyle-related diseases.

OBJECTIVE: This report describes in detail the occurrence of inflicted commotio cordis (cardiac concussion) in a previously abused 7-week-old. Though inflicted commotio cordis has been reported in three toddlers, this is the first report in a young infant. METHOD: Following documentation of abuse in a living child, the case of a death of a prior sibling--previously regarded as natural--was re-opened for further investigation. Original autopsy materials were reviewed, and the body of the deceased child was exhumed. RESULTS: Exhumation and second autopsy documented more than 50 fractures in the deceased child. When re-interviewed, the children's father admitted to causing the injuries in both children, and gave a textbook description of commotio cordis as the mechanism of death in the fatal case. CONCLUSIONS: Commotio cordis is a rare event in which a fatal dysrhythmia--usually ventricular fibrillation--is precipitated by a blow to the precordial chest. Previous reports have indicated that homicidal commotio cordis can occur in small children. This report demonstrates that commotio cordis can occur even in the very young, previously abused infant.

Critical reviews in toxicology	2010	train	14	15	5	Meta-analyses of occupational exposure as a painter and lung and bladder cancer morbidity and mortality 1950-2008.  The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified occupational painting as a human carcinogen based on lung and bladder cancers; however, no specific exposures were implicated. The authors conducted comprehensive meta-analyses of the epidemiological literature on occupational painting and these cancers. The authors abstracted study results and confounder information, and used quantile plots and regression models to evaluate heterogeneity and publication bias. Summary risk estimates were derived and sensitivity analyses performed to evaluate smoking, socioeconomic status (SES), and exposure variables. Where applicable, a Bayesian approach was used to externally adjust for smoking, a major risk factor for both cancers. For lung cancer cohort mortality studies, publication bias and heterogeneity were seen, and earlier studies reported higher risk estimates than later studies. Overall lung cancer summary risk estimates were 1.29 for case-control and 1.22 and 1.36 for cohort morbidity and mortality studies, respectively, and risk estimates for bladder cancer were 1.28 for case-control and 1.14 and 1.27 for cohort morbidity and mortality studies, respectively (all statistically significant). Risks did not differ between painters and mixed occupations. Nonsignificant summary estimates resulted for lung and bladder cancers when controlling for SES, or externally adjusting for smoking in lung cancer studies. Summary risks varied by control source for case-control studies. Residual confounding by smoking and SES, lack of exposure group effect, and publication bias limit the ability of the meta-analyses to explain associations observed between occupational painting and lung and bladder cancers. Given the long latencies for lung and bladder cancers, these weak associations, if real, may not be elucidated through studies of occupational painting today.  
26213856	Anthocyanin-Rich Diet in Chemically Induced Colitis in Mice.	Folia biologica	2015	train	13	7	0	Anthocyanin-Rich Diet in Chemically Induced Colitis in Mice.  The aetiology of inflammatory bowel diseases is unclear, but oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis. Anthocyanins--plant polyphenols--were shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential protective effects of anthocyanins on the oxidative status in mice with chemically induced colitis. Adult male mice were randomly divided into a control group drinking tap water and a colitis group drinking 1% dextran sulphate sodium solution. Animals had ad libitum access to a control wheat-based diet or food based on wheat producing anthocyanins. Bodyweight and stool consistency were monitored daily for 14 days. At the end of the experiment, colon length was measured and tissue samples were collected for the assessment of histology and oxidative status. Mice with colitis had lower body weight, higher stool score and shorter colon than control mice. Anthocyanins had neither an effect on stool consistency, nor on bodyweight loss and colon length. In the colon, liver and plasma, analysis of oxidative stress markers and antioxidant status revealed no significant differences between the groups. Food made from wheat producing anthocyanins did not protect mice from the consequences of chemically induced colitis. The measured biomarkers do not confirm the role of oxidative stress in this model of colitis. Further optimization of the anthocyanin-rich food might be needed before further experiments are conducted.

Cancer	2016	train	14	18	11	Impact of vision loss among survivors of childhood central nervous system astroglial tumors.  BACKGROUND: The impact of impaired vision on cognitive and psychosocial outcomes among long-term survivors of childhood low-grade gliomas has not been investigated previously but could inform therapeutic decision making. METHODS: Data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study were used to investigate psychological outcomes (measures of cognitive/emotional function) and socioeconomic outcomes (education, income, employment, marital status, and independent living) among astroglial tumor survivors grouped by 1) vision without impairment, 2) vision with impairment (including unilateral blindness, visual field deficits, and amblyopia), or 3) bilateral blindness. The effect of vision status on outcomes was examined with multivariate logistic regression with adjustments for age, sex, cranial radiation therapy, and medical comorbidities. RESULTS: Among 1233 survivors of childhood astroglial tumors 5 or more years after their diagnosis, 277 (22.5%) had visual impairment. In a multivariate analysis, survivors with bilateral blindness were more likely to be unmarried (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 4.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-15.0), live with a caregiver (adjusted OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.3-7.5), and be unemployed (adjusted OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.5) in comparison with those without visual impairment. Bilateral blindness had no measurable effect on cognitive or emotional outcomes, and vision with impairment was not significantly associated with any psychological or socioeconomic outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Adult survivors of childhood astroglial tumors with bilateral blindness were more likely to live unmarried and dependently and to be unemployed. Survivors with visual impairment but some remaining vision did not differ significantly with respect to psychological function and socioeconomic status from those without visual impairment.

34093019	Willingness of Ethiopian Population to Receive COVID-19 Vaccine.	Journal of multidisciplinary healthcare	2021	train	12	9	0	Willingness of Ethiopian Population to Receive COVID-19 Vaccine.  Background: Despite efforts to decrease the burden, vaccine reluctance is increasing worldwide and hindering efforts to control the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, understanding the willingness of a community to receive a COVID-19 vaccine will help to develop and implement effective means of promoting COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Objectives: This study was aimed to assess the willingness of the Ethiopian population to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and its determinant factors. Methods: E-survey was conducted from February 2021 to March 2021. After developing the questionnaire, the template was created on Google Forms and disseminated in public on different social media channels (e.g., Telegram, WhatsApp, Facebook, email, etc.) by using a shareable link. Descriptive statistics were performed. Finally, multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to assess their relationship with socio-demographic factors. Results: In total, 31.4% (n = 372) of respondents were willing to get a vaccine. One-third of respondents, 32.2% (n = 381), reported that COVID-19 vaccines are safe. Almost all 94.9% (n = 1124) responded that health workers should be vaccinated first. Only 21.7% (n = 257) willing to buy the vaccine if it is not provided free. Being female [OR (95% CI):1.85 (1.05-3.25)], aged less than 25 years old [OR (95% CI): 5.09 (3.41-7.59)], aged between 26-30 years [OR (95% CI): 3.57 (2.55-5.00)], being unmarried[OR (95% CI):1.12 (0.81-1.55)], urban in residence [OR (95% CI): 1.06 (0.69-1.62)], private sector worker in occupation [OR (95% CI):0.45 (0.26 -0.77)], university/college student [OR (95% CI): 0.88 (0.59-1.32)], not having a health-related job [OR (95% CI): 4.08 (2.57-6.48)], orthodox [OR (95% CI): 1.16 (0.61-2.19)], Muslim [OR (95% CI): 0.285 (0.13 -0.61)], educational status of university/above [OR (95% CI): 4.87 (3.15-7.53)] have a statistically significant association and were more likely willing to take COVID-19 than their counterparts. Conclusion: This study found that only 31.4% were willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Being female, older age, marital status, residence, occupations, not having a health-related job, religion, educational status were statistically significantly associated with willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

Purpose: Children in West Virginia have a high prevalence of missing permanent teeth when compared to children in the rest of the nation. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of permanent tooth hypodontia/oligodontia/anodontia in West Virginia children and to compare the prevalence by sex.Methods: Five hundred panoramic radiographs of West Virginia children, ages 6-11 years, were examined for missing permanent tooth buds/permanent teeth. Data analyses included frequency determinations, Chi square analyses, and logistic regression.Results: Sixty children (12.0%, n=500) had at least one missing permanent tooth bud/permanent tooth. There were 15.5% of females and 8.8% of males who had at least one missing permanent tooth bud/permanent tooth. In adjusted logistic regression on at least one missing permanent tooth bud/permanent tooth, females had an adjusted odds ratio of 2.11 [95% Confidence Interval: 1.18, 3.75; p = .011] compared with males. Other variables in the analysis failed to reach significance.Conclusion: In this sample of West Virginia children, females were more likely to have at least one missing permanent tooth bud/permanent tooth compared to males. Early recognition and treatment planning for dental care is needed for children with hypodontia/oligodontia/anodontia.

Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)	2020	train	8	0	0	Selection of Resistance Exercises for Older Individuals: The Forgotten Variable.  Resistance training has been widely recommended as a strategy to enhance the functional autonomy and quality of life in older individuals. Among the variables that comprise a training session, the selection of exercises stands out as an important consideration for the elderly. Although a wide range of resistance exercise options exists, current guidelines generally do not indicate which exercises should be included and which muscles should be prioritized when prescribing training for older individuals. Therefore, given the lack of evidence-based information on the topic, this paper endeavors to establish recommendations to help guide the prescription of resistance exercises for older adults.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore healthcare professionals' (HCPs') perspectives of asthma through their drawings, and their responses when viewing patients' drawings of their experiences of asthma. DESIGN: A qualitative exploratory study with a purposive, convenience sample of participants. Participants were asked to first express their perspectives of asthma in a drawing, which was followed by a review of drawings made by patients with asthma. SETTING: Primary and tertiary HCPs from Sydney, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-three HCPs from a range of health professions. RESULTS: The HCPs illustrated their perspective of asthma through drawings which were largely biomedically framed, depicting physiological and clinical aspects of asthma. In contrast, their discussion around the patients' drawings centred on the person more than the condition. The patients' drawings triggered the HCPs to revisit their personal expectations of their patients' illness experience; prompted differing degrees of acknowledgement and empathy regarding the patient experience; and encouraged clinical reflexivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide support for the educational application of patients' drawings in bringing HCPs closer to the patient lived experience. The drawings fostered deeper insight into patient perspectives of asthma and stimulated critical reflection on current healthcare practices.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of diabetes complications and the control of blood glucose, lipids and treatments in Chinese diabetic patients. METHODS: In 1994-1996, 626 Chinese diabetics were investigated for their diabetic complications, the control of blood glucose, lipids and their treatments by a multi-disciplinary team which included diabetic specialists, ophthalmologists, neurologists, nephrologists, dieticians, cardiologists, and others. RESULTS: Of these patients, 49.6% had hypertension, 46.5% neuropathy, 37.0% retinopathy, 25.4% ischemic heart disease (including 2.3% with myocardial infarction), 22.8% proteinuria (including microalbuminuria), 12.3% cerebral infarction and 1.0% amputation. 16% had preproliferative and proliferative retinopathy, and 10.5% maculopathy. 28 patients (44 eyes) were blind, but only 29% of them were checked by ophthalmologists before this screening. 36% of these patients with antihypertensive agents had their blood pressure controlled. 60% patients with hypertension were not taking any antihypertensive agent, one-third hypertensive patients had their blood pressure uncontrolled even if they had been treated with antihypertensive agents. Hyperglycemia was controlled unsatisfactorily in half of the patients. Over one-fourth of the patients had severe hyperglycemia. 24%, 48% and 59% of the patients had hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL level respectively. 21.9% kept on diabetic diet and about one-fourth had their diet uncontrolled, including 14% who had never controlled their diet even if their hyperglycemia was severe and 20% newly diagnosed diabetic patients untreated. One hundred twenty-seven newly diagnosed patients with duration less than 1 month were investigated for their diabetic complications. 19.6%, 17.8% and 42.5% of them had retinopathy, proteinuria and neuropathy. Eight patients had preproliferative and 1 had proliferative retinopathy. Three patients (5 eyes) had maculopathy. 33% of these newly diagnosed patients had hypertension, 7 severe hypertension, including 3 patients with antihypertensive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes was found late in the Chinese patients and diabetic complications had occurred in some patients by the time the disease was diagnosed. Hypertension was common in the Chinese diabetics. Over half of the diabetics had their blood glucose and blood pressure uncontrolled. Most of the diabetic patients had not controlled their diet. Macrovascular diseases and abnormal lipids metabolism were common. The risks of diabetic complications such as smoking, obesity and hypertension were not controlled and the awareness of these risks was low in the Chinese diabetics.  
29936100	Vitamin D supplementation attenuates asthma development following traffic-related particulate matter exposure.	The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology	2019	train	20	13	5	Vitamin D supplementation attenuates asthma development following traffic-related particulate matter exposure.  BACKGROUND: Recent literature suggests that children who are vitamin D deficient are uniquely susceptible to the effects of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) exposure. This is highly significant because large segments of the population reside in zones of high TRAP exposure. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether vitamin D supplementation mitigates the effect of TRAP exposure on asthma development, asthma exacerbation, and/or airway inflammation and to determine the timing of vitamin D supplementation that confers maximal health benefit. METHODS: Using established mouse models of asthma, we examined the effect of prenatal and postnatal vitamin D supplementation on asthma development, as well as the utility of vitamin D as a treatment for established asthma in the context of diesel exhaust particle (DEP) exposure. RESULTS: DEP and allergen coexposure resulted in increased airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and accumulation of pathogenic TH2/TH17 cells in the lungs of vitamin D-deficient mice compared with control mice. Prenatal and postnatal vitamin D supplementation significantly attenuated the development of AHR and decreased pulmonary accumulation of TH2/TH17 cells after coexposure to TRAP and allergen but not to allergen alone. Restoration of normal vitamin D status had no effect on AHR once asthma was already established. CONCLUSIONS: Our data establish that vitamin D confers protection against asthma development specifically in the context of TRAP exposure. Although vitamin D replacement did not reverse established asthma, restoration of normal vitamin D status in early life significantly attenuated the development of AHR in the setting of DEP-exacerbated allergic asthma and reduced numbers of lung TH2/TH17 cells, which portend the development of severe asthma.

Biomolecular concepts	2019	train	5	15	2	Comparison of the effect of vitamin D on osteoporosis and osteoporotic patients with healthy individuals referred to the Bone Density Measurement Center.  Objective Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic disease of the bones. Osteoporosis reduces bone density, predisposes a person to fractures, and imposes high costs on societies. Osteoporosis develops from a variety of causes, one of the most significant is vitamin D deficiency. This study investigates the impact of vitamin D on osteoporosis. Materials and Methods In this clinical trial, 400 patients referred to the Bone Density Clinic of Kowsar Hospital in Semnan were selected by convenience sampling method. Bone densitometry tests were carried out using DEXA (x-ray absorptiometry) and serum vitamin D levels were measured by the ELISA method. Subjects with vitamin D deficiency were treated for 8 weeks with (50,000 Vitamin D units per week. At the end of the treatment period, all subjects were evaluated for bone density and the results of both groups were compared. Results 13% of subjects had osteoporosis and 14.2% had osteopenia. 19% of subjects had vitamin D deficiency, 38.8% had insufficient levels of vitamin D, and 42.3% had sufficient vitamin D levels. The level of vitamin D in patients with osteoporosis (5.50 +/- 5.5 ng/ml) was less than those with osteopenia (7.83 +/- 4.8 ng/ml) and those with normal bone mineral density (23.88 +/- 18.42 ng/ml) (P <0.001). The prevalence of osteoporosis in the intervention group after intervention with vitamin D was significantly lower than the control group (32.3 versus 67.7 and P <0.001). Conclusion The prevalence of serum vitamin D deficiency in osteopenic and osteoporotic individuals was higher than in normal subjects, with a significant relationship between age and sex. Thus, treatment with vitamin D improves bone density indices.

The American journal of psychiatry	2005	train	16	6	3	Three psychotherapies for anorexia nervosa: a randomized, controlled trial.  OBJECTIVE: Few randomized, controlled trials have examined the efficacy of treatments for anorexia nervosa. Cognitive behavior therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy are effective in a related disorder, bulimia nervosa. There are theoretical and treatment indications for these therapies in anorexia nervosa. METHOD: Fifty-six women with anorexia nervosa diagnosed by using strict and lenient weight criteria were randomly assigned to three treatments. Two were specialized psychotherapies (cognitive behavior therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy), and one was a control treatment combining clinical management and supportive psychotherapy (nonspecific supportive clinical management). Therapy consisted of 20 sessions over a minimum of 20 weeks. RESULTS: For the total study group (intent-to-treat group), there were significant differences among therapies in the primary global outcome measure. Nonspecific supportive clinical management was superior to interpersonal psychotherapy, while cognitive behavior therapy was intermediate, neither worse than nonspecific supportive clinical management nor better than interpersonal psychotherapy. For the women completing therapy, nonspecific supportive clinical management was superior to the two specialized therapies. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that nonspecific supportive clinical management was superior to more specialized psychotherapies was opposite to the primary hypothesis and challenges assumptions about the effective ingredients of successful treatments for anorexia nervosa.

PURPOSE: To investigate whether the ingestion of olive oil having different phenolic contents influences the expression of blood pressure-related genes, involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, in healthy humans. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, crossover human trial with 18 healthy subjects, who ingested 25 mL/day of olive oils (1) high (366 mg/kg, HPC) and (2) low (2.7 mg/kg, LPC) in phenolic compounds for 3 weeks, preceded by 2-week washout periods. Determination of selected blood pressure-related gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) by qPCR, blood pressure and systemic biomarkers. RESULTS: HPC decreased systolic blood pressure compared to pre-intervention values and to LPC, and maintained diastolic blood pressure values compared to LPC. HPC decreased ACE and NR1H2 gene expressions compared with pre-intervention values, and IL8RA gene expression compared with LPC. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction to the diet of an extra-virgin olive oil rich in phenolic compounds modulates the expression of some of the genes related to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These changes could underlie the decrease in systolic blood pressure observed.

Environment international	2004	train	11	0	0	Contribution of (222)Rn-bearing water to the occupational exposure in thermal baths.  The present study investigates the short- and long-term effects of radon ((222)Rn) released from water on the progeny exposure in a thermal spa. For the purposes of this work, the Polichnitos spa was used as a case study. The bathroom was supplied with water containing 110-210 kBq m(-3) of (222)Rn. The (222)Rn concentration in air and the short-lived (222)Rn progenies in attached and unattached form were monitored into the bathroom and the surrounding premises. The equilibrium factor (F-factor) and the unattached fraction were estimated. The results of this study show that water flow during bath filling is by far the dominant mechanism by which (222)Rn is released in the air of the bathroom. The progeny exposure was correlated linearly with the (222)Rn concentration in the entering water. The annual effective dose received by a worker was found to be below the lower limit value of 3 mSv recommended by ICRP 65.

Journal of medical Internet research	2021	train	5	16	1	"Consuming Information Related to COVID-19 on Social Media Among Older Adults and Its Association With Anxiety, Social Trust in Information, and COVID-Safe Behaviors: Cross-sectional Telephone Survey.  BACKGROUND: COVID-19-related information on social media is overabundant and sometimes questionable, resulting in an ""infodemic"" during the pandemic. While previous studies suggest social media usage increases the risk of developing anxiety symptoms, how induced anxiety affects attitudes and behaviors is less discussed, let alone during a global pandemic. Little is known about the relationship between older adults using social media during a pandemic and their anxiety, their attitudes toward social trust in information, and behaviors to avoid contracting COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the associations between using social media for COVID-19-related information and anxiety symptoms as well as the mediation effect of anxiety symptoms on social trust in information and COVID-safe behaviors among older adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted in Hong Kong between May and August 2020. A rapid warm-call protocol was developed to train social workers and volunteers from participant nongovernmental organizations to conduct the telephone surveys. Questions related to COVID-safe behaviors, social trust in information, social media use, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and sociodemographic information were asked. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at the community level was used to account for the risk of contracting COVID-19. Ordinary least squares regressions examined the associations between social media use and anxiety symptoms, and how they were associated with social trust in information and COVID-safe behaviors. Structural equation modeling further mapped out these relationships to identify the mediation effects of anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: This study collected information regarding 3421 adults aged 60 years and older. Use of social media for COVID-19-related information was associated with more anxiety symptoms and lower social trust in information but had no significant relationship with COVID-safe behaviors. Anxiety symptoms predicted lower social trust in information and higher COVID-safe behaviors. Lower social trust in information was predicted by using social media for COVID-19 information, mediated by anxiety symptoms, while no mediation effect was found for COVID-safe behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults who rely on social media for COVID-19-related information exhibited more anxiety symptoms, while showing mixed effects on attitudes and behaviors. Social trust in information may be challenged by unverified and contradictory information online. The negligible impact on COVID-safe behaviors suggested that social media may have caused more confusion than consolidating a consistent effort against the pandemic. Media literacy education is recommended to promote critical evaluation of COVID-19-related information and responsible sharing among older adults.  "
28151962	Association between lifetime exposure to passive smoking and risk of breast cancer subtypes defined by hormone receptor status among non-smoking Caucasian women.	PloS one	2017	train	12	11	6	Association between lifetime exposure to passive smoking and risk of breast cancer subtypes defined by hormone receptor status among non-smoking Caucasian women.  Tobacco smoking is inconsistently associated with breast cancer. Although some studies suggest that breast cancer risk is related to passive smoking, little is known about the association with breast cancer by tumor hormone receptor status. We aimed to explore the association between lifetime passive smoking and risk of breast cancer subtypes defined by estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status among non-smoking Caucasian women. A hospital-based case-control study was performed in 585 cases and 1170 controls aged 28-90 years. Information on lifetime passive smoking and other factors was collected via a self-administered questionnaire. Logistic regression was used for analyses restricted to the 449 cases and 930 controls who had never smoked actively. All statistical tests were two-sided. Adjusted odds ratio of breast cancer was 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72-1.41) in women who experienced exposure to passive smoking at work, 1.88 (95% CI: 1.38-2.55) in women who had exposure at home, and 2.80 (95% CI: 1.84-4.25) in women who were exposed at home and at work, all compared with never exposed regularly. Increased risk was associated with longer exposure: women exposed <= 20 years and > 20 years had 1.27 (95% CI: 0.97-1.66) and 2.64 (95% CI: 1.87-3.74) times higher risk of breast cancer compared with never exposed (Ptrend < 0.001). The association of passive smoking with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer did not differ from that with hormone receptor-negative breast cancer (Pheterogeneity > 0.05). There was evidence of interaction between passive smoking intensity and menopausal status in both overall group (P = 0.02) and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer group (P < 0.05). In Caucasian women, lifetime exposure to passive smoking is associated with the risk of breast cancer independent of tumor hormone receptor status with the strongest association in postmenopausal women.

Drug and alcohol dependence	2009	train	0	2	0	Prodynorphin gene deficiency potentiates nalbuphine-induced behavioral sensitization and withdrawal syndrome in mice.  Dynorphin is the presumed endogenous ligand for the kappa-opioid receptor. The dynorphin gene may play a role in psychotropic agent-mediated behavioral changes via dopaminergic modulation. Therefore, in this study, possible involvement of the dynorphin gene in nalbuphine-mediated behavioral responses was examined using prodynorphin (Pdyn) gene knock-out (-/-) mice. Pdyn gene deficiency potentiates nalbuphine-induced behavioral sensitization of locomotor activity and accumbal c-Fos expression. Administration of nalbuphine induced a significant increase in the dialysate dopamine level in the nucleus accumbens. This increase was more pronounced in the Pdyn (-/-) mice than in the wild-type (WT) mice. In addition, Pdyn (-/-) mice were more vulnerable to the naloxone-precipitated withdrawal syndrome (i.e., teeth chattering, wet dog shakes, forepaw tremors, jumping, weight loss, and global withdrawal score) after repeated treatment with nalbuphine than the WT mice. Consistently, nor-binaltorphimine, a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist, significantly potentiated nalbuphine-induced behavioral effects in WT mice, whereas U-50488H, a kappa-opioid receptor agonist, significantly attenuated these changes in Pdyn (-/-) mice in a dose-dependent manner. Our data suggest that the kappa-opioid receptor/dynorphin system is specifically modulated in response to behavioral sensitization and withdrawal signs induced by nalbuphine.

Journal of aging and physical activity	2014	train	6	0	0	Agreement between virtual and in-the-field environmental audits of assisted living sites.  The authors investigated the use of Google Earth's Street View option to audit the presence of built environment features that support older adults' walking. Two raters conducted virtual (Street View) and in-the-field audits of 48 street segments surrounding urban and suburban assisted living sites in metropolitan Vancouver, BC, Canada. The authors determined agreement using absolute agreement. Their findings indicate that Street View may identify the presence of features that promote older adults' walking, including sidewalks, benches, public washrooms, and destinations. However, Street View may not be as reliable as in-the-field audits to identify details associated with certain items, such as counts of trees or street lights; presence, features, and height of curb cuts; and sidewalk continuity, condition, and slope. Thus, the appropriateness of virtual audits to identify microscale built environment features associated with older adults' walking largely depends on the purpose of the audits-specifically, whether the measurer seeks to capture highly detailed features of the built environment.

American journal of health promotion : AJHP	2019	train	20	10	9	Knowledge of Health Conditions Associated With Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Intake Is Low Among US Hispanic Adults.  PURPOSE: To examine associations between knowledge of health conditions and sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake among Hispanic adults. DESIGN: Quantitative, cross-sectional study. SETTING: The 2015 Estilos survey data. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand US Hispanic adults (>=18 years). MEASURES: The outcome variable was frequency of SSB intake (regular soda, fruit drink, sports/energy drink, and sweetened coffee/tea drink). Exposure variables were knowledge of 6 SSB-related health conditions (weight gain, diabetes, dental caries, high cholesterol, heart disease, and hypertension). ANALYSIS: Six multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios for consuming SSBs >=3 times/day (high intake), in relation to knowledge of SSB-related health conditions. RESULTS: Overall, 58% of Hispanic adults consumed SSBs >=2 times/day and 36% consumed SSBs >=3 times/day. Although most identified that weight gain (75%) and diabetes (76%) were related to drinking SSBs, only half identified this relation with dental caries (57%) and hypertension (41%). Even fewer identified high cholesterol (32%) and heart disease (32%) as related. In crude analyses, SSB intake was significantly associated with knowledge of the associations between SSBs and weight gain, dental caries, and heart disease; however, after adjusting for sociodemographics and acculturation, associations were no longer significant. CONCLUSIONS: Although SSB intake was very high, knowledge of SSB-related health conditions was low and was not related to high SSB intake among US Hispanic adults. Education efforts alone may not be adequate for Hispanic adults to change their behaviors.

Journal of physical activity & health	2015	train	11	1	2	Longitudinal Association Between Physical Activity and Body Fat During Adolescence: A Systematic Review.  BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) practice has been inversely associated to body fat (BF) and recommended as a way to reduce and prevent obesity. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the association of PA and BF in adolescence. METHODS: The review includes 18 longitudinal studies found in the PubMed database, comprising papers published from January 1990 to July 2014. Studies assessing BF only through body mass index were excluded. RESULTS: Among the outcomes analyzed, waist circumference, skinfolds, and absolute and relative fat mass measurement were identified. Questionnaires were the more predominant way to evaluate PA. Most studies showed that PA promotes a protective effect against a higher BF gain. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that PA has a protective effect against BF with differences between the genders and according to the BF marker or measurement assessed; higher intensity PA leads to a greater effect against BF gain in both genders; and the maintenance or increase of PA level on BF observed through analysis of change in PA level yielded more consistent findings in the relation between PA and BF.

The Foundation for a Smoke-Free World was launched in September 2017 with an announced 12-year funding commitment of $1 billion from Philip Morris International (PMI). The Foundation claims that its governing documents (certificate of incorporation, bylaws and a pledge agreement) ensure that it has an independent research agenda and stringent protections from conflicts of interest. We analysed the text of these governing documents. Their provisions have multiple loopholes, particularly regarding conflicts of interest. Further, these documents cannot substitute for other important documentation such as information about PMI's internal business case for investing $1 billion in the Foundation, an unwaivable conflict of interest policy, annual disclosure statements, copies of pre-Foundation establishment correspondence between key individuals, all signed contracts or salary information, none of which, as of July 2018, the Foundation has made publicly available. Even if these were released, however, it is problematic that the Foundation's fundamental purpose was decided on and its leader selected following a tobacco company-paid, privately negotiated arrangement with the Foundation's president. It cannot be regarded as independent.

International journal of group psychotherapy	1999	train	1	1	0	Aliveness in the work of the group: a subjective guide to creative character change.  The subjective response of aliveness in the work of the group may be a valuable signal on the journey toward creative character change in group therapy. In order to promote change in others, the group therapist must engage deeply and use internal responses as guides during interactions with group members as well as in relation to the group as a whole. Subjective awareness of increased aliveness that is linked with a sense of the work of the group may guide both therapist and group participants in the midst of inevitable anxieties and passions aroused during this quest for new vitality and freedom in relationships in the group. Winnicott's concept of potential space as well as group-relations theory about the primary task provide a conceptual foundation for this approach not only on the level of the individual member within the group but also on the level of the group as a whole.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether continuous and extended regimens (CRs/ERs) of combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) improve symptoms related to withdrawal bleeding or the hormone-free interval and to compare the efficacy, safety, and cost of CRs/ERs to those of conventional 28-day regimens. STUDY DESIGN: A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted for randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies published in any language between 2006 and 2013. RESULTS: Sixteen RCTs and 14 observational studies evaluated issues related to our objectives. CRs/ERs, whose efficacy and safety were comparable to those described for conventional regimens, were preferred due to their improvement of symptoms related to withdrawal bleeding or the hormone-free interval and the lower costs resulting from the reduced incidence of these symptoms. CONCLUSION: The contraceptive efficacy and safety of CR/ER use of CHCs is at least equal to that of 28-days conventional regimens, and this use may have some cost savings. CRs/ERs are recommended for women willing to take a CHC for treatment of symptoms related to withdrawal bleeding or the hormone-free interval.

Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research	2005	train	6	13	4	Protecting human and ecological health under viral threats in Asia.  Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbroke in 2003, and the avian influenza A (H5N1) also outbroke in 2003 and continued to 2004. These pandemic viral diseases originated in South East Asia. Many human and animal lives were lost. Economic damages due to the pandemics were also very large. The question arises of why did the pandemics originate from South East Asian areas. Human influenza A consists of many sub-types of coronaviruses including the SARS virus and the avian influenza (H5N1) that are all variants of RNA of avian coronavirus. Variants are formed during infection of a coronavirus through not only birds but also mammals, including human beings. There are hot spots where viral infection rates are accelerated among birds, mammals and human beings. Suspicious areas are in South East Asia, where living conditions of birds, mammals and human beings are so close that there are always risks of viral infection. When we see the living conditions of farmers in southern China, northern Vietnam, Laos and northern Myanmar, they commonly raise ducks/chickens with pigs sharing ponds into which they discharge household wastewater, including human excreta, and pig excreta that are significant carriers of viruses. Bird faeces are also key carriers of the viruses. In the ponds, they raise ducks and conduct fish culture. Other important players are migrating birds from North Asia, which are principal vectors of avian influenza viruses. There is an urgent necessity of improving human and ecological health in South East Asia to control viral infection among birds, mammals and human beings. We can hinder the vicious cycle of virus infection through water contamination in ponds by providing good human, pig and chicken sanitation. It is easy to provide good sanitation practices for human, pigs and chickens, introducing collection and treatment of excreta. Our modern water technology can find good solutions for the problem.

Journal of interpersonal violence	2009	train	16	1	0	Mental health correlates of intimate partner violence in marital relationships in a nationally representative sample of males and females.  It is important to understand the epidemiology of intimate partner violence (IPV) experienced by both males and females. Data were drawn from the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey Replication. The relationships between physical IPV and child abuse, mental disorders, and suicidal ideation and attempts among males and females were examined. The results indicate that child sexual abuse was associated with IPV among males, whereas child physical and sexual abuse was associated with IPV among females. IPV was associated with poor mental health outcomes for males and females, although sex differences are noted. The sex differences indicate that females experience a wider range of poor mental health outcomes compared to males. Knowledge about correlates of IPV can be useful in identifying individuals exposed to violence. Further research is required to identify effective methods to reduce exposure to IPV and to adequately address the specific needs of male and female victims of IPV.

OBJECTIVES: We report the results of the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium prospective surveillance study from January 2004 to December 2009 in 33 pediatric intensive care units of 16 countries and the impact of being in a private vs. public hospital and the income country level on device-associated health care-associated infection rates. Additionally, we aim to compare these findings with the results of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network annual report to show the differences between developed and developing countries regarding device-associated health care-associated infection rates. PATIENTS: A prospective cohort, active device-associated health care-associated infection surveillance study was conducted on 23,700 patients in International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium pediatric intensive care units. METHODS: The protocol and methodology implemented were developed by International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium. Data collection was performed in the participating intensive care units. Data uploading and analyses were conducted at International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium headquarters on proprietary software. Device-associated health care-associated infection rates were recorded by applying Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network device-associated infection definitions, and the impact of being in a private vs. public hospital and the income country level on device-associated infection risk was evaluated. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Central line-associated bloodstream infection rates were similar in private, public, or academic hospitals (7.3 vs. 8.4 central line-associated bloodstream infection per 1,000 catheter-days [p < .35 vs. 8.2; p < .42]). Central line-associated bloodstream infection rates in lower middle-income countries were higher than low-income countries or upper middle-income countries (12.2 vs. 5.5 central line-associated bloodstream infections per 1,000 catheter-days [p < .02 vs. 7.0; p < .001]). Catheter-associated urinary tract infection rates were similar in academic, public and private hospitals: (4.2 vs. 5.2 catheter-associated urinary tract infection per 1,000 catheter-days [p = .41 vs. 3.0; p = .195]). Catheter-associated urinary tract infection rates were higher in lower middle-income countries than low-income countries or upper middle-income countries (5.9 vs. 0.6 catheter-associated urinary tract infection per 1,000 catheter-days [p < .004 vs. 3.7; p < .01]). Ventilator-associated pneumonia rates in academic hospitals were higher than private or public hospitals: (8.3 vs. 3.5 ventilator-associated pneumonias per 1,000 ventilator-days [p < .001 vs. 4.7; p < .001]). Lower middle-income countries had higher ventilator-associated pneumonia rates than low-income countries or upper middle-income countries: (9.0 vs. 0.5 per 1,000 ventilator-days [p < .001 vs. 5.4; p < .001]). Hand hygiene compliance rates were higher in public than academic or private hospitals (65.2% vs. 54.8% [p < .001 vs. 13.3%; p < .01]). CONCLUSIONS: Country socioeconomic level influence device-associated infection rates in developing countries and need to be considered when comparing device-associated infections from one country to another.  
11284628	Underlying and proximate determinants of diarrhoea-specific infant mortality rates among municipalities in the state of Céara, north-east Brazil: an ecological study.	Journal of biosocial science	2001	train	15	11	7	Underlying and proximate determinants of diarrhoea-specific infant mortality rates among municipalities in the state of Ceara, north-east Brazil: an ecological study.  This ecological study examines the variations in diarrhoea-specific infant mortality rates among municipalities in the State of Ceara, north-east Brazil, using data from a community health workers' programme. Diarrhoea is the main cause of postneonatal deaths in Ceara, and diarrhoea mortality rates vary substantially among municipalities, from 7 to 50 per thousand live births. To determine the inter-relationships between potential predictors of diarrhoea-specific infant mortality, eleven variables were classified into proximate determinants (i.e. adequate weight gain and exclusive breast-feeding in first 4 months) and underlying determinants (i.e. health services and socioeconomic variables). The health services variables included percentage with prenatal care up-to-date, participation in growth monitoring and immunization up-to-date, while the socioeconomic factors included female illiteracy rate, per capita gross municipality product and percentage of households with low income, percentage of households with inadequate water supply and inadequate sanitation, and urbanization. Using linear regression analysis variables were included from each group to build regression models. The significant determinants of variability in diarrhoea-specific infant mortality between municipalities were prevalence of infants exclusively breast-feeding, percentage of infants with adequate weight gain, percentage of pregnant women with prenatal care up-to-date, female illiteracy rate and inadequate water supply. These findings suggest that community-based promotion of exclusive breast-feeding in the first 4 months and care-giving behaviours that prevent weight faltering, including weaning practices and feeding during and following diarrhoea episodes, may further reduce municipality-level diarrhoea-specific mortality. Primary heath care strategies addressing these two proximate determinants provide only a partial solution to reducing diarrhoeal disease mortality. Improvements in municipal health services (prenatal care) and socioeconomic status variables, including water supply and maternal education, can also contribute to reduction of infant mortality due to diarrhoea. These results may be used by government health officials to set priorities by considering not only the strength of the association between selected risk factors and diarrhoea mortality rates, but also the prevalence of the risk factors being considered at the municipality level. Finally, the methods used are applicable to other settings with community-based primary health care decentralized to the state or municipal level.

International journal of group psychotherapy	2013	train	8	0	0	Structured Play Therapy Groups for Preschoolers: facilitating the emergence of social competence.  Over the years, we have developed a working model of Structured Play Therapy Groups for Preschoolers, an innovative treatment approach designed to address the needs of young children ages 3 to 5 struggling to adjust to the social demands of their preschool classrooms. These short-term therapy groups facilitate development of the young child's social competence and capacity to participate effectively in a classroom environment. Although the literature on therapy groups for children suggests that preschoolers are not yet evolved enough developmentally to engage actively in a group process, our experience indicates otherwise. The model of treatment presented here will therefore challenge that contention with the claim that not only can preschoolers participate in a structured therapy group of peers but they can, by virtue of that very participation, benefit in ways that will prepare them (as they transition from preschool to kindergarten) for the ever-increasing demands of their ever-expanding social milieus.

The American journal of clinical nutrition	2005	train	7	10	3	Folate and cobalamin deficiencies and hyperhomocysteinemia in Bangladesh.  BACKGROUND: Indian Asian men residing in the United Kingdom have a higher prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia than do their European counterparts. This has been largely attributed to dietary deficiencies in cobalamin associated with vegetarianism among these Indian Asians. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to ascertain the prevalence of folate and cobalamin deficiencies and hyperhomocysteinemia in Bangladesh. DESIGN: Plasma concentrations of homocysteine, folate, and cobalamin and urinary concentrations of creatinine were assessed in 1650 adults in Bangladesh. RESULTS: The prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia (men: >11.4 micromol/L; women: >10.4 micromol/L) was markedly (P < 0.0001) greater among men (63%; x +/- SD: 15.3 +/- 9.5 micromol/L) than among women (26%; 9.5 +/- 4.7 micromol/L). Folate was lower (9.8 +/- 6.5 and 12.3 +/- 7.6 nmol/L, respectively), whereas cobalamin was higher (281 +/- 115 and 256 +/- 118 pmol/L, respectively) (P < 0.0001 for both) among men than among women. Folate explained 15% and cobalamin explained 5% of the variation in homocysteine concentrations. For men, folate (P = 0.005) and cobalamin (P = 0.03) were positively correlated with urinary creatinine. Smoking (P < 0.0003) and betelnut use (P < 0.0002) were independent negative predictors of folate. CONCLUSIONS: Bangladeshi men have a high prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia, which is more closely associated with folate than with cobalamin, although other factors, eg, smoking and betelnut use, may also contribute to its cause. The positive correlations between urinary creatinine and plasma folate and cobalamin were unanticipated and could suggest that, in marginal nutrition, these vitamins may be limiting for creatine biosynthesis.  
33302256	Association of Social Media Use With Mental Health Conditions of Nonpatients During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Insights from a National Survey Study.	Journal of medical Internet research	2020	train	16	29	9	Association of Social Media Use With Mental Health Conditions of Nonpatients During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Insights from a National Survey Study.  BACKGROUND: Considerable research has been devoted to examining the mental health conditions of patients with COVID-19 and medical staff attending to these patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are few insights concerning how the pandemic may take a toll on the mental health of the general population, and especially of nonpatients (ie, individuals who have not contracted COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association between social media use and mental health conditions in the general population based on a national representative sample during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: We formed a national representative sample (N=2185) comprising participants from 30 provinces across China, who were the first to experience the COVID-19 outbreak in the world. We administered a web-based survey to these participants to analyze social media use, health information support received via social media, and possible psychiatric disorders, including secondary traumatic stress (STS) and vicarious trauma (VT). RESULTS: Social media use did not cause mental health issues, but it mediated the levels of traumatic emotions among nonpatients. Participants received health information support via social media, but excessive social media use led to elevated levels of stress (beta=.175; P<.001), anxiety (beta=.224; P<.001), depression (beta=.201; P<.001), STS (beta=.307; P<.001), and VT (beta=.688; P<.001). Geographic location (or geolocation) and lockdown conditions also contributed to more instances of traumatic disorders. Participants living in big cities were more stressed than those living in rural areas (P=.02). Furthermore, participants from small cities or towns were more anxious (P=.01), stressed (P<.001), and depressed (P=.008) than those from rural areas. Obtaining more informational support (beta=.165; P<.001) and emotional support (beta=.144; P<.001) via social media increased their VT levels. Peer support received via social media increased both VT (beta=.332; P<.001) and STS (beta=.130; P<.001) levels. Moreover, geolocation moderated the relationships between emotional support on social media and VT (F2=3.549; P=.029) and the association between peer support and STS (F2=5.059; P=.006). Geolocation also interacted with health information support in predicting STS (F2=5.093; P=.006). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has taken a severe toll on the mental health of the general population, including individuals who have no history of psychiatric disorders or coronavirus infection. This study contributes to the literature by establishing the association between social media use and psychiatric disorders among the general public during the COVID-19 outbreak. The study findings suggest that the causes of such psychiatric disorders are complex and multifactorial, and social media use is a potential factor. The findings also highlight the experiences of people in China and can help global citizens and health policymakers to mitigate the effects of psychiatric disorders during this and other public health crises, which should be regarded as a key component of a global pandemic response.

PURPOSE: The association of second hand smoke or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and periodontitis in non-smokers has not been confirmed using a biomarker of ETS exposure. To estimate periodontitis prevalence in non-smokers with detectable serum cotinine, and to investigate racial/ethnic and socioeconomic variation in ETS exposure in a representative sample of the U. S. adult population. Determining periodontitis risk indicators occurring with ETS appears to be a salient purpose as this study is the first of its kind to provide a link (a salivary biomarker) between second hand smoke and risk for periodontitis. METHODS: Data were collected from the 1999 to 2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Subjects were 3,137 adults who had smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes and had not used other forms of tobacco. ETS exposure was classified as negligible (cotinine concentrations below sex and race/ethnicity cut-points for smokers), moderate (cotinine 0.5-<1.5 mug/mL) or high (cotinine >= 1.5 ng/mL). Periodontitis was classified according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) case definition for moderate-severe disease. Survey estimation procedures were used to estimate prevalence and odds ratios (OR) were from multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: ETS exposure was observed in 40.5% of subjects and 2.6% had periodontitis. ETS exposure was inversely associated with educational attainment and family income and was higher in non-Hispanic blacks than whites. After adjusting for age, sex and year of survey, adults with high ETS exposure (cotinine >= 1.5 ng/mL) had more than twice the odds of periodontitis as people with negligible exposure (OR=2.3, 95% confidence interval=1.3, 4.1). CONCLUSION: High ETS exposure was a risk indicator for periodontitis in lifetime non-smokers.

The contents of the study included questionnaire survey, physical measurement and blood tests for fasting blood triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) level was calculated by TC level minus HDL-C level. Chi-square test and non-conditional logistic regression model were used to analyze the factors that contributed to dyslipidemia.  Results: The dyslipidemia rate was 18.6%, and the abnormal rates of TG, TC, LDL-C, non-HDL-C and HDL-C were 6.8%, 5.6%, 2.3%, 4.2% and 8.6%, respectively. By chi-square test, the dyslipidemia rate in students with different ages, home locations, BMI groups, central obesity, time on watching TV or playing computer per day, and daily sleep time was statistically significant. Non-conditional logistic regression analysis showed that home location for the city (OR=1.332), overweight (OR=1.548), obesity (OR=2.201), central obesity (OR=1.695), watching TV or playing computer for more than 2 hours per day (OR=1.357), daily sleep time longer than 11 hours (OR=2.518) were the risk factors for dyslipidemia in students from the primary and middle schools.   Conclusion: Nearly 1/5 primary and middle school students show dyslipidemia, which is associated with obesity and other bad behaviors.  
24037117	Quantifying the contributions of behavioral and biological risk factors to socioeconomic disparities in coronary heart disease incidence: the MORGEN study.	European journal of epidemiology	2013	train	15	16	6	Quantifying the contributions of behavioral and biological risk factors to socioeconomic disparities in coronary heart disease incidence: the MORGEN study.  Quantifying the impact of different modifiable behavioral and biological risk factors on socioeconomic disparities in coronary heart disease (CHD) may help inform targeted, population-specific strategies to reduce the unequal distribution of the disease. Previous studies have used analytic approaches that limit our ability to disentangle the relative contributions of these risk factors to CHD disparities. The goal of this study was to assess mediation of the effect of low education on incident CHD by multiple risk factors simultaneously. Analyses are based on 15,067 participants of the Dutch Monitoring Project on Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases aged 20-65 years examined 1994-1997 and followed for events until January 1, 2008. Path analysis was used to quantify and test mediation of the low education-CHD association by behavioral (current cigarette smoking, heavy alcohol use, poor diet, and physical inactivity) and biological (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia) risk factors. Behavioral and biological risk factors accounted for 56.6 % (95 % CI 42.6-70.8 %) of the low education-incident CHD association. Smoking was the strongest mediator, accounting for 27.3 % (95 % CI 17.7-37.4 %) of the association, followed by obesity (10.2 %; 95 % CI 4.5-16.1 %), physical inactivity (6.3 %; 95 % CI 2.7-10.0 %), and hypertension (5.3 %; 95 % CI: 2.8-8.0 %). In summary, in a Dutch cohort, the majority of the relationship between low education and incident CHD was mediated by traditional behavioral and biological risk factors. Addressing barriers to smoking cessation, blood pressure and weight management, and physical activity may be the most effective approaches to eliminating socioeconomic inequalities in CHD.

Indoor air	2000	train	22	0	0	Nicotine and 3-ethenylpyridine concentrations as markers for environmental tobacco smoke in restaurants.  The Finnish Tobacco Act has restricted smoking in public places since 1976, and in 1994 the Act was amended to include workplaces as well. In 2000, the Tobacco Act will be expanded further to restaurants. In Finland, the exposure of clients and employees to the vapor phase environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in restaurants has not been systematically studied before by measuring ETS markers in indoor air. However, in these establishments the concentrations of ETS are expected to be much higher than in other workplaces. Gaseous nicotine and 3-ethenylpyridine were used as indicators of ETS in three different types of restaurants. Mean concentrations of nicotine ranged from 1.4-42.2 micrograms/m3 and 3-ethenylpyridine 1.4-6.3 micrograms/m3. In addition, concentrations of total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), CO and CO2 were measured and concentrations were 183-2215 micrograms/m3, 0.9-3.1 mg/m3 and 600-880 ppm, respectively. The concentrations of ETS markers were highest in discos and nightclubs and lowest in restaurants. The concentrations of total volatile organic compounds were highest in discos and nightclubs, especially when smoke generators were used.

Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco	2019	train	10	0	0	Potential Mandated Lowering of Nicotine Levels in Cigarettes: A Plant Perspective.  The Food and Drug Administration has announced the potential for mandated lowering of nicotine levels in combustible cigarettes. The World Health Organization has recommended a lowering of cigarette filler nicotine levels to below 0.4 mg/g. To devise appropriate nicotine control strategies, regulators must consider technical feasibility, timelines for compliance, and potential impediments to implementation. Outlined here is previously unsummarized information on genetic approaches that might be used to reduce nicotine levels in cured tobacco leaves. For the benefit of regulators, altered alkaloid or toxicant profiles that might result by implementation of some of these methodologies are discussed. Also mentioned are potential licensing or regulatory impediments to use of some of the technologies per se. Implications: An understanding of technical feasibility of plant-based nicotine reduction technologies, along with the potential for corresponding alterations in alkaloid or toxicant profiles, is needed by regulators to develop effective nicotine control strategies with minimal impediments or undesirable consequences.  
20056585	Residential pesticides and childhood leukemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Environmental health perspectives	2010	train	12	6	7	Residential pesticides and childhood leukemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of previous observational epidemiologic studies examining the relationship between residential pesticide exposures during critical exposure time windows (preconception, pregnancy, and childhood) and childhood leukemia. DATA SOURCES: Searches of MEDLINE and other electronic databases were performed (1950-2009). Reports were included if they were original epidemiologic studies of childhood leukemia, followed a case-control or cohort design, and assessed at least one index of residential/household pesticide exposure/use. No language criteria were applied. DATA EXTRACTION: Study selection, data abstraction, and quality assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Random effects models were used to obtain summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). DATA SYNTHESIS: Of the 17 identified studies, 15 were included in the meta-analysis. Exposures during pregnancy to unspecified residential pesticides (summary OR = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.13-2.11; I2 = 66%), insecticides (OR = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.80-2.32; I2 = 0%), and herbicides (OR = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.20-2.16; I2 = 0%) were positively associated with childhood leukemia. Exposures during childhood to unspecified residential pesticides (OR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.12-1.70; I2 = 4%) and insecticides (OR = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.33-1.95; I2 = 0%) were also positively associated with childhood leukemia, but there was no association with herbicides. CONCLUSIONS: Positive associations were observed between childhood leukemia and residential pesticide exposures. Further work is needed to confirm previous findings based on self-report, to examine potential exposure-response relationships, and to assess specific pesticides and toxicologically related subgroups of pesticides in more detail.

Journal of medical Internet research	2019	train	12	21	0	Adolescent Perspectives on the Use of Social Media to Support Type 1 Diabetes Management: Focus Group Study.  BACKGROUND: A majority of adolescents report the use of some form of social media, and many prefer to communicate via social networking sites. Social media may offer new opportunities in diabetes management, particularly in terms of how health care teams provide tailored support and treatment to adolescents with diabetes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the experiences and perspectives of adolescents with type 1 diabetes on the feasibility of social media use as a tool to collaboratively manage their diabetes with their diabetes care team. METHODS: Focus groups of adolescents with type 1 diabetes were conducted in the Seattle metropolitan area in Washington State. Semistructured questions were used to elicit views around the preferred means of communication with the adolescents' diabetes care team, how to best support diabetes self-management, and how social media could be used outside of the clinic setting by the diabetes care team to engage with adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative content analysis was carried out, and emergent themes were subsequently mapped onto 4 domains of feasibility, which included acceptability, demand, implementation, and practicality. RESULTS: Participants included 45 adolescents with type 1 diabetes (mean age 15.9, SD 1.7 years; 58% male; diabetes duration mean 6.2, SD 3.6 years; 76% on insulin pumps; 49% wore continuous glucose monitors; 93% reported use of social media; 84% used smartphones as the primary means for social media access). A total of 7 major topics were identified and mapped onto areas consistent with our focus on feasibility. For acceptability and demand, participants expressed how communication over social media could help facilitate (1) improved communication outside of clinic visits to optimize diabetes management, (2) independence in diabetes self-management, (3) connection to other youth with diabetes for additional diabetes support, and (4) delivery of more timely and personalized care. Addressing implementation and practicality, participants shared the need to (1) ensure patient privacy, (2) maintain professional nature of provider-patient relationship, and (3) recognize that social media is not currently used for medical care by youth with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with type 1 diabetes expressed interest in the use of social media as a tool to support diabetes management and increase engagement with their diabetes care team. Specific implementation measures around privacy and professionalism should be considered when developing a social media intervention to facilitate communication between adolescents and care teams.

Cancer causes & control : CCC	2009	train	18	9	9	Physical activity and breast cancer risk among pre- and postmenopausal women in the U.S. Radiologic Technologists cohort.  To clarify aspects of the association between physical activity and breast cancer, such as activity intensity required, and possible effect modification by factors such as menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use. We prospectively examined physical activity in relation to breast cancer risk among 45,631 women participating in the U.S. Radiologic Technologists cohort. Participants provided information at baseline regarding hours spent per week engaging in strenuous activity, walking/hiking for exercise, and walking at home or work. We estimated multivariable relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of breast cancer using Cox regression. We identified 864 incident-invasive breast cancers. Greatest risk reduction was observed among women who reported walking/hiking for exercise 10 or more hours per week (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34-0.95) compared with those reporting no walking/hiking. The association between walking/hiking for exercise and breast cancer was modified by MHT use (p for interaction = 0.039). Postmenopausal women who never used MHT had reduced risks of breast cancer associated with physical activity whereas no relation was observed among ever users of MHT. Our study suggests moderate intensity physical activity, such as walking, may protect against breast cancer. Further, the relation between physical activity and breast cancer may be modified by MHT use.

Studies have suggested that women who experience child sexual abuse are at risk for developing symptoms related to anorexia nervosa and bulimia. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationships among childhood sexual and physical abuse, body image disturbance, and eating disorder symptomatology. Of 670 female college students screened for childhood abuse, 29 sexually abused, 32 physically abused, and 29 nonabused women completed measures of eating disorder symptoms, psychological factors thought to be related to eating disorders, and body image distortion. Contrary to previous reports, there was no evidence that child sexual or physical abuse was associated with the development of body image disturbance. Furthermore, the results did not support the hypothesis that child sexual and physical abuse are related to eating disorder symptomatology. It is suggested that subjects who are victims of child sexual abuse and who are receiving psychotherapy manifest higher rates of a number of different types of psychopathology, including eating disorders.

Globalization and health	2021	train	10	7	0	Mental health solutions for domestic violence victims amid COVID-19: a review of the literature.  BACKGROUND: Due to COVID-19, domestic violence victims face a range of mental health challenges, possibly resulting in substantial human and economic consequences. However, there is a lack of mental health interventions tailored to domestic violence victims and in the context of COVID-19. In this study, we aim to identify interventions that can improve domestic violence victims' mental health amid the COVID-19 pandemic to address the research gap. MAIN TEXT: Drawing insights from established COVID-19 review frameworks and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information on interventions that can address domestic violence victims' mental health challenges amid COVID-19. We identified practical and timely solutions that can be utilized to address mental health challenges domestic violence victims face amid COVID-19, mainly focusing on (1) decreasing victims' exposure to the abuser and (2) increasing victims' access to mental health services. CONCLUSION: Domestic violence is a public health crisis that affects all demographics and could result in significant morbidity and mortality. In addition to emphasizing mental health challenges faced by domestic violence victims, multidisciplinary interventions are identified that could provide timely and practical solutions to domestic violence victims amid the pandemic, which range from tailored shelter home strategies, education programs, escape plans, laws and regulations, as well as more technology-based mental health solutions. There is a significant need for more multipronged and multidisciplinary strategies to address domestic violence amid and beyond the pandemic, particularly interventions that could capitalize on the ubiquity and cost-effectiveness of technology-based solutions.

Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection	2012	train	10	15	3	The third analysis of cancer mortality among Japanese nuclear workers, 1991-2002: estimation of excess relative risk per radiation dose.  The present study estimated excess relative risk per sievert (ERR/Sv) of cancer mortality among the cohort of 200 583 male Japanese nuclear workers, with an average individual cumulative dose of 12.2 mSv (<10 mSv, 75.4%; 100 + mSv, 2.6%), conducting Poisson regression using dose category specific observed and expected numbers of deaths, and average doses obtained from the official report of the Radiation Effects Association (REA) on the analysis of mortality of Japanese nuclear industry workers for 1991-2002, which reported the estimates of ERR/Sv  for leukaemia but not for all cancers or any other cancer site. The possible confounding biases from drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco were evaluated by examining the association of cumulative radiation dose with the mortality of cancers related to drinking or smoking. For leukaemia (80 deaths), the estimate of ERR/Sv was - 1.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) = - 6.12, 8.57). For all cancers excluding leukaemia (2636 deaths), while the ERR/Sv was estimated to be 1.26 (95%CI = - 0.27, 3.00), confounding by alcohol consumption was suspected since the ERR/Sv  estimate of alcohol-related cancers was 4.64 (95%CI = 1.13, 8.91) and the ERR/Sv  estimate of all cancers excluding leukaemia and alcohol-related cancers was 0.20 (95%CI = - 1.42, 2.09). In conclusion, confounding by important lifestyle factors related to cancer risk may have a substantial effect on risk estimates, especially when conducting studies of low cumulative dose and, accordingly, low statistical power. Pooled analysis or meta-analysis of nuclear workers for solid cancers needs to take this point into account.

International archives of allergy and immunology	2013	train	14	17	4	Analysis of the prevalence of and risk factors for atopic dermatitis using an ISAAC questionnaire in 8,750 Korean children.  BACKGROUND: Since 1995, epidemiologic studies of atopic disorders using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire have been performed in many countries, including the Republic of Korea. The prevalence, burden and risk factors of atopic dermatitis were surveyed in these studies, which helped to enhance their comparability among different areas and age groups, as well as to clarify the nature of atopic dermatitis and other atopic disorders. METHODS: From 21 facilities, 8,750 children were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The data were collected via the Internet using a questionnaire based on the Korean-language version of the ISAAC study format. RESULTS: The prevalence of atopic dermatitis over the previous 12 months was 14.4%. The prevalence in preschool children was significantly higher than in elementary school children. Family history of atopic diseases, diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis and diagnosis of food allergy were positively associated with atopic dermatitis in both preschool and elementary school children. In addition, raising pets was positively associated with atopic dermatitis in preschool children. In elementary school children, female gender, secondhand smoking, breastfeeding, changing the parents' house to a newly built one during the first year of life, diagnosis of asthma and diagnosis of allergic rhinitis were positively associated with atopic dermatitis. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of atopic dermatitis in preschool and elementary school children in Korea is similar to that of children in other developing countries. The risk factors for atopic dermatitis are different in preschool and elementary school children. More detailed strategies will be necessary to reduce atopic dermatitis in both age groups.  
12799487	The chemical bases of the various AIDS epidemics: recreational drugs, anti-viral chemotherapy and malnutrition.	Journal of biosciences	2003	train	15	18	2	The chemical bases of the various AIDS epidemics: recreational drugs, anti-viral chemotherapy and malnutrition.  In 1981 a new epidemic of about two-dozen heterogeneous diseases began to strike non-randomly growing numbers of male homosexuals and mostly male intravenous drug users in the US and Europe. Assuming immunodeficiency as the common denominator the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) termed the epidemic, AIDS, for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. From 1981-1984 leading researchers including those from the CDC proposed that recreational drug use was the cause of AIDS, because of exact correlations and of drug-specific diseases. However, in 1984 US government researchers proposed that a virus, now termed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the cause of the non-random epidemics of the US and Europe but also of a new, sexually random epidemic in Africa. The virus-AIDS hypothesis was instantly accepted, but it is burdened with numerous paradoxes, none of which could be resolved by 2003: Why is there no HIV in most AIDS patients, only antibodies against it? Why would HIV take 10 years from infection to AIDS? Why is AIDS not self-limiting via antiviral immunity? Why is there no vaccine against AIDS? Why is AIDS in the US and Europe not random like other viral epidemics? Why did AIDS not rise and then decline exponentially owing to antiviral immunity like all other viral epidemics? Why is AIDS not contagious? Why would only HIV carriers get AIDS who use either recreational or anti-HIV drugs or are subject to malnutrition? Why is the mortality of HIV-antibody-positives treated with anti-HIV drugs 7-9%, but that of all (mostly untreated) HIV-positives globally is only 1.4%? Here we propose that AIDS is a collection of chemical epidemics, caused by recreational drugs, anti-HIV drugs, and malnutrition. According to this hypothesis AIDS is not contagious, not immunogenic, not treatable by vaccines or antiviral drugs, and HIV is just a passenger virus. The hypothesis explains why AIDS epidemics strike non-randomly if caused by drugs and randomly if caused by malnutrition, why they manifest in drug- and malnutrition-specific diseases, and why they are not self-limiting via anti-viral immunity. The hypothesis predicts AIDS prevention by adequate nutrition and abstaining from drugs, and even cures by treating AIDS diseases with proven medications.

Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunita	2014	train	5	24	1	Cancer risk among farmers in the Province of Vercelli (Italy) from 2002 to 2005: an ecological study.  BACKGROUND: As the link between agricultural pesticides and numerous types of human cancers is wellknown. Farmers living in the Province of Vercelli (Italy) were observed to verify if they have a higher cancer risk than the rest of the local employed population. Literature showed a well-known excess of cancer morbidity and mortality in the Province of Vercelli, but only few studies focused on cancer incidence in local farmers. Studying farmers could allow to assess the causal importance respectively of environmental pressure and professional exposure factors in explaining cancer excesses in the above-mentioned area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present ecological study considered all cancer new cases recorded among the mean employed population with a range of age from 25 to 84 years and resident in the Province of Vercelli during the four-year period 2002-2005. Cancer odds ratios, by gender and type of cancer, between farmers and non-farmers were calculated. RESULTS: Farmers showed a higher risk for the following tumors: colorectal (OR 2.38, IC95%: 1,76-2,87), leaukaemia (OR 2.65, IC95%:2,12-2,89), digestive system (OR 2.16, IC95% 1,92-2,33), lymphoma OR 2.08, IC95%:1,99-2,23), melanoma (OR 2.90, IC95%:2,54-3,15), myeloma OR 3.55, IC95%:3,23-3,70), pancreas OR 3.38, IC95%:3,14-3,61), lung (1.59, IC95%:1,12-2,38) and kidney (2.70, IC95%:2,41-2,99). Males showed a higher risk for lung cancer, females for liver neoplasm, melanoma and lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Farmers showed a higher risk for several cancers. Further studies are needed, in order to examine in detail the issue, to encourage the use of personal protective equipment and to promote a more responsible pesticides use.  
17935569	Hygiene theory and allergy and asthma prevention.	Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology	2007	train	1	8	0	Hygiene theory and allergy and asthma prevention.  Epidemiological trends of allergic diseases and asthma in children reveal a global rise in their prevalence over the past 50 years. Their rapid rise, especially in metropolitan locales, suggests that recent changes in modern environments and/or life styles underlie these trends. One environmental/life style factor that may be contributing to this trend is called the hygiene hypothesis: that naturally occurring microbial exposures in early life may have prompted early immune maturation and prevented allergic diseases and asthma from developing. Subsequently, children raised in modern metropolitan life styles, relatively devoid of this natural microbial burden, may have under-stimulated immune systems in infancy, thereby allowing for the 'allergic march'- a pattern of pro-allergic immune development and disorders that occurs in early life. Over the past 15 years, hygiene theorising has evolved in shape and substance, in part due to a growing and strengthening burden of evidence from epidemiological, translational and basic research. What was speculation may be key clues to allergy and asthma prevention. The objectives of this article are to summarise the epidemiological trends and allergic march of childhood that may be explained by hygiene theory, to overview current hygiene theory paradigms and to exemplify the strengthening epidemiological evidence in support of the hygiene theory, using bacterial endotoxin exposure as a prototypical example.

Social science & medicine (1982)	2011	train	18	9	4	Impact of occupational stress on stroke across occupational classes and genders.  The aims of the present study were to analyze the association between incident stroke, occupational class and stress and to examine whether the association is found in both men and women in a prospective study of Japanese male and female workers. A total of 3190 male and 3363 female Japanese community-dwelling workers aged 65 or under with no history of cardiovascular disease were followed. Occupational stress was evaluated using a demand-control questionnaire. The impact on stroke was examined in stratified analyses of occupational classes. We identified 147 incident strokes (91 in men and 56 in women) during the 11-year follow-up period. Men with high strain jobs (combination of high job demand and low job control) were nearly three times more likely to suffer from a stroke than men with low strain jobs (combination of low job demand and high job control). Among male workers in low occupational classes (blue-collar and non-managerial work), job strain was associated with a higher risk of stroke. In contrast, there was no association between job strain and incident stroke among male workers in high occupational classes (white-collar and managerial work). No statistically significant differences were found for stroke incidence among the job characteristic categories in all the female participants. However, significant, over five-fold excess risks were found among white-collar and managerial female workers exposed to high job strain, compared with their counterparts with low strain jobs. Our study of Japanese workers provided supportive evidence for vulnerability to occupational stress among lower occupational class workers in males but not in females.

Journal of sleep research	2017	train	7	1	0	Gabapentin acutely increases the apnea-hypopnea index in older men: data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  Although drugs with sedative properties may increase the risk of airway collapse during sleep, their acute effects on the apnea-hypopnea index in older adults are under-reported. We investigated the acute effects of gabapentin (GABA) on sleep breathing in older men without sleep apnea. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over pilot study using a bedtime dose of gabapentin 300 mg was conducted in eight non-obese older men. Polysomnography measured the effects of the intervention. The apnea-hypopnea index was higher in the gabapentin arm than in the placebo arm (22.4 +/- 6.1 versus 12.2 +/- 4.3, P <= 0.05, d: 0.67), as was the oxygen desaturation index (20.6 +/- 5.8 versus 10.8 +/- 3.9, P <= 0.05, d: 0.68). The number needed to harm was four. A subset analysis demonstrated that differences in sleep respiratory parameters were present only during non-rapid eye movement sleep, as well as only in the supine position. No adverse events were reported. Hence, gabapentin worsened sleep breathing acutely compared with placebo. Long-term clinical trials are warranted to elucidate the clinical relevance of these findings for the safety profile of GABAergic agents.

A case-control comparison of lung cancer deaths versus deaths from all other cancers occurring in Alameda County, California, between 1958 and 1962 was conducted to investigate possible associations between lung cancer and occupation. Age-adjusted, sex-specific analyses indicated that a history of work in certain industries and occupations was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Among males, a significant positive association was found for glass, metal, furniture, professional and photographic equipment, rubber, leather and plastic manufacturing; water and air transportation; auto repair services; and construction. Specific occupations associated with a significant positive risk for males were: electricians, aircraft mechanics, painters, plasterers, machine operators, construction workers, bus and truck drivers, and guards and nightwatchmen. Among females, beauticians had a significantly high risk associated with lung cancer. These results were consistent with other studies of lung cancer related to occupation.

OBJECTIVE: The present study sought to determine whether the 12-session pre- to posttest therapeutic gains that had been found by Deblinger, Lippmann. and Steer (1996) for an initial sample of 100 sexually abused children suffering posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms would be sustained 2 years after treatment. METHOD: These sexually abused children, along with their nonoffending mothers, had been randomly assigned to one of three cognitive-behavioral treatment conditions, child only, mother only, or mother and child, or a community comparison condition, and were followed for 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after treatment. RESULTS: A series of repeated MANCOVAs, controlling for the pre-test scores, indicated that for the three measures of psychopathology that had significantly decreased in the original study (i.e., externalizing behavior problems, depression, and PTSD symptoms), these measures at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years were comparable to the posttest scores. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the pre- to post-treatment improvements held across the 2-year follow-up period. The clinical and research implications of these findings are discussed.

Escherichia coli are major bacterial pathogens causing bovine mastitis, a disease of great economic impact on dairy production worldwide. This work aimed to study the virulence determinants of mammary pathogenic E. coli (MPEC). By whole-genome sequencing analysis of 40 MPEC and 22 environmental (""dairy-farm"" E. coli [DFEC]) strains, we found that only the fec locus (fecIRABCDE) for ferric dicitrate uptake was present in the core genome of MPEC and that it was absent in DFEC genomes (P < 0.05). Expression of the FecA receptor in the outer membrane was shown to be citrate dependent by mass spectrometry. FecA was overexpressed when bacteria were grown in milk. Transcription of the fecA gene and of the inner membrane transport component fecB gene was upregulated in bacteria recovered from experimental intramammary infection. The presence of the fec system was shown to affect the ability of E. coli to grow in milk. While the rate of growth in milk of fec-positive (fec(+)) DFEC was similar to that of MPEC, it was significantly lower in DFEC lacking fec Furthermore, deletion of fec reduced the rate of growth in milk of MPEC strain P4, whereas fec-transformed non-mammary gland-pathogenic DFEC strain K71 gained the phenotype of the level of growth in milk observed in MPEC. The role of fec in E. coli intramammary pathogenicity was investigated in vivo in cows, with results showing that an MPEC P4 mutant lacking fec lost its ability to induce mastitis, whereas the fec(+) DFEC K71 mutant was able to trigger intramammary inflammation. For the first time, a single molecular locus was shown to be crucial in MPEC pathogenicity.IMPORTANCE Bovine mastitis is the major infectious disease in dairy cows and the leading cause of economic loss to the global dairy industry, directly contributing to the price of dairy products on supermarket shelves and the financial hardships suffered by dairy farmers. Mastitis is also the leading reason for the use of antibiotics in dairy farms. Good farm management practices in many countries have dramatically reduced the incidence of contagious mastitis; however, the problems associated with the incidence of environmental mastitis caused by bacteria such as Escherichia coli have proven intractable. E. coli bacteria cause acute mastitis, which affects the health and welfare of cows and in extreme cases may be fatal. Here we show for the first time that the pathogenicity of E. coli causing mastitis in cows is highly dependent on the fecIRABCDE ferric citrate uptake system that allows the bacterium to capture iron from citrate. The Fec system is highly expressed during infection in the bovine udder and is ubiquitous in and necessary for the E. coli bacteria that cause mammary infections in cattle. These results have far-reaching implications, raising the possibility that mastitis may be controllable by targeting this system.  "
31789561	Subjective social status in adolescents with asthma: Psychosocial and physical health outcomes.	Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association	2020	train	21	9	3	Subjective social status in adolescents with asthma: Psychosocial and physical health outcomes.  OBJECTIVE: Asthma prevalence and morbidity are disproportionately higher among youth with lower socioeconomic status (SES). Examination of subjective social status (SSS) may improve understanding of associations between SES and health outcomes in pediatric asthma. METHOD: Fifty adolescents with asthma (Mage = 13.2 years, SD = 1.23; 54% male; 55.1% African American) completed the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status-Youth Version, Daily Life Stressors Scale, Children's Depression Inventory-Short Form, Adolescent Sleep-Wake Scale-short version, and Asthma Control Test during the baseline visit of a study of health behaviors. Body mass index z scores (BMIz) were calculated using height and weight obtained during the visits. Hierarchical linear regressions examined associations between SSS and psychosocial and physical health outcomes, controlling for caregiver-reported objective SES. RESULTS: Caregiver-reported objective SES was not associated with adolescent SSS. SSS-society was associated with daily stress (b = -3.14), t(47) = -2.13, p = .033; asthma control (beta = .34, p = .045); BMIz (beta = .38, p = .013); and sleep quality (beta = .49, p = .001). SSS-community was associated with daily stress (b = -3.76), t(46) = -3.07, p = .002, and sleep quality (beta = .36, p = .010). SSS was not associated with depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents' SSS may not always reflect caregiver's objective SES. Perceived social status may play a role in the experience of daily stress, asthma control, BMIz, and sleep quality among adolescents with asthma. SSS may offer a novel means of assessing health disparities in pediatric asthma. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).  
16268181	Obesity risk factors in the ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) in Mexico City.	Revista alergia Mexico (Tecamachalco, Puebla, Mexico : 1993)	2005	train	23	14	23	Obesity risk factors in the ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) in Mexico City.  BACKGROUND: The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) has promoted surveys in asthma and allergic diseases using standardized methodologies including validated questionnaires. Many items in the questionnaires have also been implied in the overweight and obesity etiology. OBJECTIVE: To describe the factors associated with obesity in subjects of 6-7 years and 13-14 years in the ISAAC survey in Mexico City. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were obtained from questionnaires of children participating in a phase 3b ISAAC survey. Logistic regression was used to determine the obesity risks factors. RESULTS: The factors related to obesity were weekly consumption of meat (+, positive relationship), vegetables, pasta, rice (+) and quartiles of birth weight (+) in boys of 6-7 years. Having suffered eczema at any time, weekly consumption of fruit, pasta, butter, nuts, potato (+), fast food (+), daily TV viewing (+) in girls of 6-7years. Having suffered eczema at any time, weekly consumption of pasta (+), butter, potato, weekly physical exercise in boys of 13-14 years; weekly consumption of pasta, margarine, milk, fast food (+), currently smoking in girls of 13-14 years. CONCLUSIONS: There were not common factor patterns for the different groups, birth weight, fast food, TV viewing and lack of exercise have been previously related to pediatric obesity. Asthma was not associated with a higher risk of obesity but medical history of eczema was associated with lower risk of obesity in the 6-7 years girls, and 13-14 years boys. The present study provides the bases for future epidemiological studies and gives some clues on possible public health actions.  
22196520	Respiratory health effects of air pollution: update on biomass smoke and traffic pollution.	The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology	2012	train	16	9	11	Respiratory health effects of air pollution: update on biomass smoke and traffic pollution.  Mounting evidence suggests that air pollution contributes to the large global burden of respiratory and allergic diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, and possibly tuberculosis. Although associations between air pollution and respiratory disease are complex, recent epidemiologic studies have led to an increased recognition of the emerging importance of traffic-related air pollution in both developed and less-developed countries, as well as the continued importance of emissions from domestic fires burning biomass fuels, primarily in the less-developed world. Emissions from these sources lead to personal exposures to complex mixtures of air pollutants that change rapidly in space and time because of varying emission rates, distances from source, ventilation rates, and other factors. Although the high degree of variability in personal exposure to pollutants from these sources remains a challenge, newer methods for measuring and modeling these exposures are beginning to unravel complex associations with asthma and other respiratory tract diseases. These studies indicate that air pollution from these sources is a major preventable cause of increased incidence and exacerbation of respiratory disease. Physicians can help to reduce the risk of adverse respiratory effects of exposure to biomass and traffic air pollutants by promoting awareness and supporting individual and community-level interventions.  
11157583	Daytime sleepiness and EEG spectral analysis in apneic patients before and after treatment with continuous positive airway pressure.	Chest	2001	train	10	14	1	Daytime sleepiness and EEG spectral analysis in apneic patients before and after treatment with continuous positive airway pressure.  BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by recurrent apneas during sleep, resulting in repetitive hypoxemic episodes and interruptions of the normal sleep pattern. A previous study showed EEG slowing (ie, a higher ratio of delta + theta frequencies to alpha + beta frequencies on EEG) during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and wakefulness in untreated OSAS patients. STUDY AND OBJECTIVES: To determine whether EEG slowing is reversible with continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) treatment and to verify whether the persistence of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is correlated with residual slowing of the EEG. PATIENTS: Ten healthy subjects (9 men and 1 woman) and 14 patients with moderate-to-severe OSAS (13 men and 1 woman) were studied before and after 6 months of treatment with CPAP. RESULTS: Untreated OSAS patients showed EEG slowing in frontal and central cortical regions during both wakefulness and during REM sleep compared to healthy control subjects. This EEG slowing was found to be independent of time spent with arterial oxygen saturation < 90%, severity of OSAS, or mean sleep latency as determined by the multiple sleep latency test. CPAP treatment was found to correct the EEG slowing for both REM sleep and wakefulness. Daytime sleepiness also greatly improved with treatment, but some degree of somnolence remained. CONCLUSION: CPAP treatment was found to correct the EEG slowing that was observed in untreated OSAS patients. Persistent EDS may be related to persistent obesity after CPAP treatment.  
12055820	Lack of influence of red palm oil on severity of malaria infection in pre-school Nigerian children.	Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene	2002	train	20	6	3	Lack of influence of red palm oil on severity of malaria infection in pre-school Nigerian children.  Vitamin A supplements are reported to reduce febrile episodes of malaria and parasite counts, especially in children aged 12-36 months. Red palm oil (RPO) is a good source of vitamin A, is rich in alpha- and beta-carotene and is as effective as high-dose retinyl palmitate supplements in improving vitamin A status. In western Nigeria, where malaria is endemic, RPO is widely used and consumption can be measured using plasma alpha-carotene as a proxy biomarker since there are few other prominent sources of this carotene in the diet. The influence of RPO consumption on malaria was investigated in 207 children (aged 0-60 months) who presented with fever in August-October 1999 at several hospital clinics around Ile-Ife. Medical and anthropometric data, body temperature, parasitaemia and plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), retinol, carotenoids and tocopherols were measured in the children. Mothers were interviewed on usage of cooking oil and mosquito nets in the home, education and occupation. Most families used RPO and median plasma concentrations of both alpha-carotene (0.518 mumol/L) and beta-carotene (0.698 mumol/L) in the children were high. Using body temperature, parasite density and plasma CRP as markers of disease severity, multiple linear regression analysis was carried out on those for whom complete data were available (n = 138), separated into 3 age-groups of < 12 months (n = 37), 12-36 months (n = 68) and > 36 months (n = 33). In the absence of plasma retinol, plasma alpha-carotene explained 13.9% of the variance in parasite density (P = 0.013) but only in children aged > 36 months. The relationship with disease severity was negative, i.e., there was some evidence that RPO usage protected against malaria, and other dietary indices generally indicated that better nutritional status was associated with a lower severity of malaria.  
16758316	A review on pharmacological activities and utilization technologies of pumpkin.	Plant foods for human nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands)	2006	train	10	0	0	A review on pharmacological activities and utilization technologies of pumpkin.  Dietary plants and herbal preparations have been traditionally used as medicine in developing countries and obtained a resurgence of use in the United States and Europe. Research carried out in last few decades has validated several such claims of use of traditional medicine plants. Popularity of pumpkin in various systems of traditional medicine for several ailments (antidiabetic, antihypertensive, antitumor, immunomodulation, antibacterial, antihypercholesterolemia, intestinal antiparasitia, antiinflammation, antalgic) focused the investigators' attention on this plant. Considerable evidence from several epidemiological studies concerning bioactivities leads have stimulated a number of animal model, cell culture studies and clinical trials designed to test this pharmacological actions. In addition, it was found that technologies such as germination and fermentation could reduce antinutritional materials and affect the pharmacological activities of pumpkin. This review will focus on the main medicinal properties and technologies of pumpkin, and point out areas for future research to further elucidate mechanisms whereby this compound may reduce disease risk.  
27087620	Sleep quality in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome.	Clinical and experimental rheumatology	2016	train	13	11	3	Sleep quality in patients with primary Sjoegren's syndrome.  OBJECTIVES: To assess the sleep quality in primary Sjoegren's syndrome (pSS) patients and evaluate its relationship with the disease, quality of life and mood disorders. METHODS: The sleep quality of 29 pSS women and 29 matched controls was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Seven domains are grouped according to three factors: F1 perceived sleep quality (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, use of sleeping medication), F2 sleep efficiency (sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency) and F3 daily disturbances (sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction). These domains are scored as a single factor of global sleep quality. The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) fatigue scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were also administered. Disease activity and damage were evaluated with the EULAR Sjoegren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI), the Sjoegren's Syndrome Disease Activity and Damage Indexes (SSDAI, SSDDI). RESULTS: The mean PSQI global score had higher pathological values (8.6+/-4.6) compared with controls (5.6+/-2.2) (p=0.002). F1 and F3 were significantly worse in cases (p=0.01, p=0.009). A negative correlation was found between SF-36 subscales and the global PSQI, F2 and F3. The anxiety HADS correlated with F2 and F3, while depression only with F3. No correlation with FACIT and disease indexes emerged. CONCLUSIONS: Using PSQI, an impaired sleep quality was demonstrated in pSS patients, especially with perceived quality and the daily disturbances. It is associated with a reduced quality of life but not with disease-related variables.  
31010279	Risk factors associated with the recent cholera outbreak in Yemen: a case-control study.	Epidemiology and health	2019	train	15	10	15	Risk factors associated with the recent cholera outbreak in Yemen: a case-control study.  OBJECTIVES: The cholera outbreak in Yemen has become the largest in the recent history of cholera records, having reached more than 1.4 million cases since it started in late 2016. This study aimed to identify risk factors for cholera in this outbreak. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in Aden in 2018 to investigate risk factors for cholera in this still-ongoing outbreak. In total, 59 cholera cases and 118 community controls were studied. RESULTS: The following risk factors were associated with being a cholera case in the bivariate analysis: a history of travelling and having had visitors from outside Aden Province; eating outside the house; not washing fruit, vegetables, and khat (a local herbal stimulant) before consumption; using common-source water; and not using chlorine or soap in the household. In the multivariate analysis, not washing khat and the use of common-source water remained significant risk factors for being a cholera case. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioural factors and unsafe water appear to be the major risk factors in the recent cholera outbreak in Yemen. In order to reduce the risk of cholera, hygiene practices for washing khat and vegetables and the use and accessibility of safe drinking water should be promoted at the community level.  
26454559	Psychological Characteristics of Problem Gamblers With and Without Mood Disorder.	Canadian journal of psychiatry. Revue canadienne de psychiatrie	2015	train	7	13	4	Psychological Characteristics of Problem Gamblers With and Without Mood Disorder.  OBJECTIVE: Problem and pathological gamblers are significantly more likely to experience mood disorders, compared with the general population. Our study examined the relation of psychological characteristics (personality, trait impulsiveness, and gambling motives) to current co-occurring mood disorder (major depression and dysthymia) status among problem and pathological gamblers. METHOD: Problem and pathological gamblers (N = 150) underwent a clinical interview to assess current co-occurring mood disorders; participants completed measures of problem gambling severity, personality, impulsiveness, and gambling motives. RESULTS: Problem and pathological gamblers with a current co-occurring mood disorder were more likely to be female, older, and to report higher lifetime and past-year gambling severity. A co-occurring mood disorder was associated with higher personality scores for alienation and stress reaction, lower scores for well-being, social closeness, and control, as well as higher impulsiveness scores for urgency and lack of premeditation, and lower sensation seeking scores. Participants with a co-occurring mood disorder also reported higher coping motives for gambling. Multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that personality factors (lower social closeness and higher alienation) contributed to the greatest likelihood of being diagnosed with a co-occurring mood disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Mood disorders frequently co-occur with problem and pathological gambling, and they are associated with greater gambling severity. These findings highlight that interpersonal facets of personality contribute substantially to co-occurring mood disorder status. Implications for treatment will be discussed.

The Permanente journal	2018	train	5	9	1	Using Neighborhood-Level Census Data to Predict Diabetes Progression in Patients with Laboratory-Defined Prediabetes.  CONTEXT: Research on predictors of clinical outcomes usually focuses on the impact of individual patient factors, despite known relationships between neighborhood environment and health. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether US census information on where a patient resides is associated with diabetes development among patients with prediabetes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of all 157,752 patients aged 18 years or older from Kaiser Permanente Northern California with laboratory-defined prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose, 100 mg/dL-125 mg/dL, and/or glycated hemoglobin, 5.7%-6.4%). We assessed whether census data on education, income, and percentage of households receiving benefits through the US Department of Agriculture's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) was associated with diabetes development using logistic regression controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, blood glucose levels, and body mass index. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Progression to diabetes within 36 months. RESULTS: Patients were more likely to progress to diabetes if they lived in an area where less than 16% of adults had obtained a bachelor's degree or higher (odds ratio [OR] =1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09-1.36), where median annual income was below $79,999 (OR = 1.16 95% CI = 1.03-1.31), or where SNAP benefits were received by 10% or more of households (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.1-1.4). CONCLUSION: Area-level socioeconomic and food assistance data predict the development of diabetes, even after adjusting for traditional individual demographic and clinical factors. Clinical interventions should take these factors into account, and health care systems should consider addressing social needs and community resources as a path to improving health outcomes.  
16626805	Uranium levels in the diet of São Paulo City residents.	Environment international	2006	train	7	0	0	Uranium levels in the diet of Sao Paulo City residents.  Natural levels of uranium in the diet of Sao Paulo City residents were studied, and radionuclide concentrations were measured by the fission track method on samples of typical adult food items. This information was used to evaluate the daily intake of uranium in individuals living in Sao Paulo City which is, according to our findings, around 0.97 microg U/day. Using the ICRP Uranium-model, we estimated the uranium accumulation and committed doses in some tissues and organs, as function of time. We compared the output of the ICRP uranium biokinetic model, tailored for the conditions prevailing in Sao Paulo, with experimental data from other localities. Such comparison was possible by means of a simple method we developed, which allows normalization among experimental results from different regions where distinct values of chronic daily intake are observed.

Journal of clinical nursing	2018	train	10	5	1	"Oral hygiene practices and knowledge among stroke-care nurses: A multicentre cross-sectional study.  AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate oral health knowledge for stroke care and the clinical practices performed for oral hygiene care in Malaysia. BACKGROUND: Oral hygiene care following stroke is important as the mouth can act as a reservoir for opportunistic infections that can lead to aspirational pneumonia. DESIGN: A national cross-sectional survey was conducted in Malaysia among public hospitals where specialist stroke rehabilitation care is provided. METHODS: All (16) hospitals were invited to participate, and site visits were conducted. A standardised questionnaire was employed to determine nurses' oral health knowledge for stroke care and existing clinical practices for oral hygiene care. Variations in oral health knowledge and clinical practices for oral hygiene care were examined. RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed by 806 nurses across 13 hospitals. Oral health knowledge scores varied among the nurses; their mean score was 3.7 (SD 1.1) out of a possible 5.0. Approximately two-thirds (63.6%, n = 513) reported that some form of ""mouth cleaning"" was performed for stroke patients routinely. However, only a third (38.3%, n = 309) reported to perform or assist with the clinical practice of oral hygiene care daily. Their oral health knowledge of stroke care was associated with clinical practices for oral hygiene care (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical practice of providing oral hygiene care is less than ideal, and there are deficiencies in oral health knowledge for stroke care. Oral health knowledge was associated with clinical practice of providing oral hygiene care. This has implications for training and integrating oral hygiene care within stroke rehabilitation.  "
21733735	Occupational exposure in parkinsonian disorders: a 43-year prospective cohort study in men.	Parkinsonism & related disorders	2011	train	24	15	36	Occupational exposure in parkinsonian disorders: a 43-year prospective cohort study in men.  BACKGROUND: Several occupations and occupational exposures have been investigated for associations with Parkinson's disease. Common findings are increased risk associated with pesticide exposure and no association between Parkinson's disease and welding. METHODS: We explored the association between a broad range of possible occupational risk factors and Parkinson's disease as well as Parkinson's disease plus other forms of Parkinsonism (referred to as Parkinsonian disorders), using prospectively collected data in the population-based Swedish Twin Registry. A cohort of 14,169 Swedish men was followed for up to 43 years. We identified 234 Parkinsonian disorder cases including 204 Parkinson's disease cases with complete data. We assessed exposure to 14 chemical and biological compounds through a job exposure matrix. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for age, smoking, and education were used to estimate the relative risk of disease associated with exposure. RESULTS: Exposure to inorganic dust was associated with increased risk of Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonian disorders, HR 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.4) and 1.5 (1.0-2.2) respectively. There was no association between Parkinson's disease or Parkinsonian disorders and occupational exposure to pesticides, welding smoke, metal dust, wood dust, animal handling, stone and concrete dust, chrome and nickel dust, quartz dust, organic dust, oil, asbestos, organic solvents and irritating gas. CONCLUSIONS: Inorganic dust should be explored further as a potential risk factor for Parkinson's disease. Occupational exposure to pesticides and twelve other compounds explored in this study may not be associated with risk of Parkinson's disease in Swedish men.

Tobacco control	2020	train	16	0	0	Tobacco price elasticity in Serbia: evidence from a middle-income country with high prevalence and low tobacco prices.  In this paper, we use Deaton's demand model and Household Budget Survey data from 2006 to 2017 to provide a first robust and reliable estimate of cigarettes price elasticity for Serbia. The case of Serbia is particularly interesting and important as it provides evidence for a country in which tobacco market is characterised by the high tobacco consumption, low prices and large perceived impact of multinational tobacco companies on public revenues, export and employment, given their considerable cigarette production in Serbia. The price elasticity of cigarettes is estimated at -0.639, in line with the previous estimates for the low-income and middle-income countries. Estimated negative cigarettes price elasticity for Serbia suggests that tobacco tax policy could be used effectively to reduce cigarette consumption in Serbia, which could lower the harmful health effects of cigarettes. Furthermore, a calculation based on the estimated elasticity suggests that increasing tobacco taxes could also have positive fiscal effects, as the expected revenue from the taxes would increase.

Meeting report of NFI: Nutrition Foundation of Italy symposium.  The use of palm oil by the food industry is increasingly criticized, especially in Italy, for its purported negative effects on human health and environment. This paper summarizes the conclusions of a Symposium on this topic, gathered by the Nutrition Foundation of Italy, among experts representing a number of Italian Medical and Nutritional Scientific Societies. Toxicological and environmental issues were not considered. Participants agreed that: no evidence does exist on the specific health effects of palm oil consumption as compared to other saturated fatty acids-rich fats; the stereospecific distribution of saturated fatty acids in the triacylglycerol molecule of palm oil limits their absorption rate and metabolic effects; in agreement with International guidelines, saturated fatty acids intake should be kept <10% of total energy, within a balanced diet; within these limits, no effect of palm oil consumption on human health (and specifically on CVD or cancer risk) can be foreseen.

Morbidity and mortality weekly report	1997	train	9	9	9	Monthly estimates of leisure-time physical inactivity--United States, 1994.  Physical inactivity increases the risk for heart disease, diabetes, colon cancer, high blood pressure, obesity, osteoporosis, muscle and joint disorders, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, approximately one third of adults in the United States report no leisure-time physical activity, and rates of inactivity have been higher in January than in June. Among adults, the prevalence of leisure-time physical inactivity is highest among those who are older, Hispanic, and residing in southern states. A national health objective for the year 2000 is to reduce to < or = 15% the proportion of persons reporting no leisure-time physical activity (objecive 1.5). To assist in monitoring efforts to achieve this objective, CDC analyzed data from the 1994 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance system (BRFSS) and estimated for each month the proportion of adults from selected demographic groups who reported no leisure-time physical activity. The findings indicate seasonal patterns in the prevalence of reported leisure-time physical inactivity; however, monthly rates of inactivity were higher and more stable among older persons, Hispanics, and residents of southern states.  
3456458	Relationship of cutaneous malignant melanoma to individual sunlight-exposure habits.	Journal of the National Cancer Institute	1986	train	16	10	9	Relationship of cutaneous malignant melanoma to individual sunlight-exposure habits.  The relationships of different histologic types of cutaneous malignant melanoma to occupational and recreational sunlight exposure, habits of clothing, sunburn histories, and use of sunscreening agents were examined in a case-control study of 507 patients and 507 matched controls in Western Australia. Variations in relationships according to the primary site of melanoma were also examined. An increased incidence rate of superficial spreading melanoma was associated with low total outdoor exposure in early adulthood and frequent participation in boating and fishing. Superficial spreading melanoma of the trunk was also related to frequency of sunbathing at ages 15-24 years and of exposure of the trunk while working outdoors. In women the rate ratio for all types of melanoma occurring on the trunk was estimated at 13.0 (95% confidence interval, 2.0-83.9) in those who wore a bikini or bathed nude at ages 15-24 years compared with those wearing a conservative one-piece bathing suit. There was little evidence that sunbathing or wearing a bikini within 10 years of case diagnosis were risk factors for melanoma of the trunk. After control of confounding due to constitutional factors, only Hutchinson's melanotic freckle melanoma showed a relationship to severe sunburn. For nodular melanoma, sunburn appeared to be protective. Although many of the results supported the hypothesis that melanomas other than the Hutchinson's melanotic freckle type are related to occasional bursts of recreational sun exposure during a susceptible period in early adult life, little support for the hypothesis was obtained when recreational sun exposure was expressed as a proportion of total outdoor exposure, which had been considered a priori to be an index of intermittent sunlight exposure.  
21421743	Long-term sedentary work and the risk of subsite-specific colorectal cancer.	American journal of epidemiology	2011	train	11	13	6	Long-term sedentary work and the risk of subsite-specific colorectal cancer.  Research suggests that sedentary behavior may increase the risk of some chronic diseases. The aims of the study were to examine whether sedentary work is associated with colorectal cancer and to determine whether the association differs by subsite. A total of 918 cases and 1,021 controls participated in a population-based case-control study of colorectal cancer in Western Australia in 2005-2007. Data were collected on lifestyle, physical activity, and lifetime job history. The estimated effects of sedentary work on the risk of cancers of the proximal colon, distal colon, and rectum were analyzed by using multinomial logistic regression. Compared with participants who did not spend any time in sedentary work, participants who spent 10 or more years in sedentary work had almost twice the risk of distal colon cancer (adjusted odds ratio = 1.94, 95% confidence interval: 1.28, 2.93) and a 44% increased risk of rectal cancer (adjusted odds ratio = 1.44, 95% confidence interval: 0.96, 2.18). This association was independent of recreational physical activity and was seen even among the most recreationally active participants. Sedentary work was not associated with the risk of proximal colon cancer. These results suggest that long-term sedentary work may increase the risk of distal colon cancer and rectal cancer.

Journal of sleep research	2004	train	13	0	0	The relationship between daytime exposure to light and night-time sleep in 6-12-week-old infants.  This project investigated the relationship between exposure to light and 24-h patterns of sleep and crying in young, healthy, full-term babies living at home and following a normal domestic routine. Measures included an ankle worn activity monitor, an external light monitor and the Barr Baby Day Diary in which parents recorded periods of sleep, crying, feeding and other behaviours at 5-min intervals throughout the 24-h period. Fifty-six babies (26 males and 30 females) were monitored across three consecutive days at 6, 9 and 12 weeks of age. There was an early evening peak in crying which was associated with reduced sleep at 6 weeks. Across the trials there was a gradual shift towards a greater proportion of sleep occurring at night. Sleeping well at 6 weeks was a good indication of more night-time sleep at 9 and 12 weeks. Babies who slept well at night were exposed to significantly more light in the early afternoon period. These data suggest that light in the normal domestic setting influences the development of the circadian system.  
26542069	Genetic causal beliefs about obesity, self-efficacy for weight control, and obesity-related behaviours in a middle-aged female cohort.	Psychology & health	2016	train	17	9	2	Genetic causal beliefs about obesity, self-efficacy for weight control, and obesity-related behaviours in a middle-aged female cohort.  OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a heritable condition with well-established risk-reducing behaviours. Studies have shown that beliefs about the causes of obesity are associated with diet and exercise behaviour. Identifying mechanisms linking causal beliefs and behaviours is important for obesity prevention and control. DESIGN: Cross-sectional multi-level regression analyses of self-efficacy for weight control as a possible mediator of obesity attributions (diet, physical activity, genetic) and preventive behaviours in 487 non-Hispanic White women from South King County, Washington. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported daily fruit and vegetable intake and weekly leisure-time physical activity. RESULTS: Diet causal beliefs were positively associated with fruit and vegetable intake, with self-efficacy for weight control partially accounting for this association. Self-efficacy for weight control also indirectly linked physical activity attributions and physical activity behaviour. Relationships between genetic causal beliefs, self-efficacy for weight control, and obesity-related behaviours differed by obesity status. Self-efficacy for weight control contributed to negative associations between genetic causal attributions and obesity-related behaviours in non-obese, but not obese, women. CONCLUSION: Self-efficacy is an important construct to include in studies of genetic causal beliefs and behavioural self-regulation. Theoretical and longitudinal work is needed to clarify the causal nature of these relationships and other mediating and moderating factors.

In practice	2018	train	9	11	8	Impact of Lifestyle Interventions Targeting Healthy Diet, Physical Activity, and Weight Loss on Asthma in Adults: What Is the Evidence?  Unhealthy lifestyle factors such as poor diet quality, sedentary lifestyle, and obesity are associated with negative health consequences in asthma including poor asthma control, impaired quality of life, and greater health care utilization. Lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of behavioral treatments and has been effective in chronic diseases such as atherothrombotic vascular disease and diabetes. There is a critical need for lifestyle interventions in asthma care that address obesity and its intimately linked risk behaviors in terms of poor diet and physical inactivity. We present in this commentary the promising lifestyle interventions emerging in asthma care that target poor diet, physical inactivity and weight loss, the proposed mechanisms of these lifestyle interventions, and the critical need for guideline-concordant lifestyle interventions in asthma care.  
21979764	Prevention of root caries.	Evidence-based dentistry	2011	train	17	9	7	Prevention of root caries.  DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. INTERVENTION: Elders having at least five teeth with exposed roots, no serious medical problems and basic self-care ability (including oral hygiene practices) were randomly allocated into one of four prevention groups. Individualised oral hygiene instruction was provided to each participant, focusing on effective brushing with a manual toothbrush, and use of fluoride toothpaste was recommended. Before applications of the study agents, a piece of gauze was used to clean and dry the teeth. Then water (placebo control), chlorhexidine varnish (Cervitec, Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan, Liechtenstein), sodium fluoride varnish (Duraphat, Pharbil Waltrop GmbH, Waltrop, Germany) or SDF solution (Saforide, Toyo Seiyaku Kasei Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was applied onto the exposed root surfaces of participants in the respective groups by means of a disposable microbrush. The participants were instructed not to eat for half an hour after treatment. Applications of water or SDF solution were repeated every 12 months, and applications of chlorhexidine varnish or sodium fluoride varnish were repeated every three months. OUTCOME MEASURES: Root Caries Index (RCI) was calculated as follows: (no. of root caries lesions/no. of teeth with gingival recession/person) x 100. Treatment effects were also measured by prevented fraction (PF), relative risk and the number (of elders) needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one elder from developing root caries. RESULTS: Two thirds (203/306) of the included elders were followed for three years. Significantly lower relative risks for developing new root caries were found in the elders in the chlorhexidine, sodium fluoride and SDF groups compared with the control (OHI only) group. The mean numbers of new root caries surfaces in the four groups were 2.5, 1.1, 0.9 and 0.7 respectively (ANOVA, p < 0.001). The prevented fraction and numbers needed to treat are shown in Table 1. CONCLUSIONS: Applications of SDF solution, sodium fluoride varnish and chlorhexidine varnish are more effective in preventing new root caries than OHI alone. The results of this study provide support for the clinical and community use of the three test materials, in addition to improvement in oral hygiene, to prevent the development of root caries in institutionalised elders.

The objective of the dental disease prevention and early intervention program at Youngstown State University is to 1) educate future dental hygienists on the provision of primary care in a non-traditional dental care setting and 2) provide access to preventive and simple restorative care for an underserved rural Appalachian population. Through their education in dental public health courses, students are prepared to provide preventive oral healthcare services to underserved populations in non-traditional clinical settings. Senior dental hygiene students in the dental public health course sequence work in pairs, along with a supervising dentist using a mobile dental unit at the Child and Family Health Services Clinic in Lisbon, Ohio. Ninety-eight hours of preventive oral health services and simple restorative care were provided in 1996. Student evaluations of the overall extramural clinical experience were positive. The program is an example of a collaborative community-based approach to meet the oral health needs of low-income families.  
10629447	The environmental predictors of allergic disease.	The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology	2000	train	13	8	2	The environmental predictors of allergic disease.  The prevalence of allergic diseases has been on the rise for the last 200 years, when hay fever, an easy and obvious-to-recognize illness, was virtually unknown in Europe and North America. Genetic factors are unlikely to explain these rapid increases. Among the potential environmental factors, exposure to ambient air pollution has been intensely debated. Besides passive smoking, which has convincingly been shown to increase the risk for asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness among exposed children, the evidence to suggest that outdoor pollution to sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, diesel exhaust, and ozone is causally related with the inception of allergic diseases is poor. Rather, factors associated with the lifestyle of populations or families, such as socioeconomic status, allergen exposure, sibship size, early childhood infections, dietary habits, and growing up in anthroposophic families or a farming environment, may prove to be of greater relevance. The future challenge is to tackle the complex interplay between environmental factors and genetic determinants that will eventually contribute to a better understanding and to better prevention strategies for such multifactorial conditions as asthma and allergies.  
21847891	Metaphors as contextual evidence for engaging Haitian clients in practice: a case study.	American journal of psychotherapy	2011	train	0	1	0	Metaphors as contextual evidence for engaging Haitian clients in practice: a case study.  Haitian immigrants remain underserved in the United States (U.S.), despite their large presence and their visibility, which increased after the January 12, 2010 earthquake. Employing cultural-specific practice strategies to engage Haitians in the U.S. who experienced loss in their social networks, requires understanding the context of their ecological culture and consideration of relevant linguistic and cultural elements. Through a case example, we describe the use of metaphors in cultural language as part of a strategy used to engage a Haitian immigrant with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. Outcomes indicate that the use of storytelling and metaphors facilitate disclosure of clients' worldviews, experiences, feelings and hopes in a safe environment while providing them with tools to determine progress. We identify four practice guidelines for intervention strategies with ethnic minority groups who share similar cultural contexts. Metaphors, which are a viable approach to practice, focus on cultural strengths and resiliencies over traditional models of deficit and can enhance access to needed effective services for underserved populations, such as Haitians in the United States.  
29615446	Longitudinal study of occupational noise exposure and joint effects with job strain and risk for coronary heart disease and stroke in Swedish men.	BMJ open	2018	train	15	21	5	Longitudinal study of occupational noise exposure and joint effects with job strain and risk for coronary heart disease and stroke in Swedish men.  OBJECTIVES: The aims were to investigate whether occupational noise increased the risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke and to elucidate interactions with stressful working conditions in a cohort of Swedish men. DESIGN: This is a prospective cohort study on CHD and stroke in Swedish men followed until death, hospital discharge or until 75 years of age, using Swedish national registers on cause of death and hospital discharges. Baseline data on occupation from 1974 to 1977 were used for classification of levels of occupational noise and job demand-control. Cox regression was used to analyse HRs for CHD and stroke. SETTING: Swedish men born in 1915-1925. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: CHD and stroke. PARTICIPANTS: The participants of the study were men from the Primary Prevention Study, a random sample of 10 000 men born in 1915-1925 in Gothenburg. Subjects with CHD or stroke at baseline or were not employed were excluded. The remaining subjects with complete baseline data on occupation, weight, height, hypertension, diabetes, serum cholesterol and smoking constituted the study sample (5753 men). RESULTS: There was an increased risk for CHD in relation to noise levels 75-85 dB(A) and >85 dB(A) compared with <75 dB(A) (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.31, and HR 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.63, respectively). Exposure to noise peaks also increased the risk for CHD (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.38). Among those with high strain (high demands and low control) combined with noise >75 dB(A), the risk for CHD further increased (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.73). There was no significantly increased risk for stroke in any noise category. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to occupational noise was associated with an increased risk for CHD and the risk further increased among those with concomitant exposure to high strain. None of the analysed variables were related to increased risk for stroke.

The American journal of psychiatry	2000	train	27	8	0	Nicotine transdermal patch and atypical antipsychotic medications for smoking cessation in schizophrenia.  OBJECTIVE: Schizophrenic patients have high rates of cigarette smoking. The authors compared the outcomes of two group psychotherapy programs for smoking cessation in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were also treated with the nicotine transdermal patch and with either atypical or typical antipsychotic medications. METHOD: Forty-five subjects were randomly assigned to 1) the group therapy program of the American Lung Association (N=17) or 2) a specialized group therapy program for smokers with schizophrenia (N=28) that emphasized motivational enhancement, relapse prevention, social skills training, and psychoeducation. All subjects participated in 10 weeks of treatment with the nicotine transdermal patch (21 mg/day) and 10 weekly group therapy sessions and continued to receive their prestudy atypical (N=18) or typical (N=27) antipsychotic medications. Outcome variables included treatment retention, rate of smoking abstinence, and expired-breath carbon monoxide level. RESULTS: Smoking abstinence rates did not differ in the two group therapy programs. However, atypical antipsychotic agents, in combination with the nicotine transdermal patch, significantly enhanced the rate of smoking cessation (55.6% in the atypical agent group versus 22.2% in the typical group), which was reflected by a significant effect of atypical versus typical agents on carbon monoxide levels. Risperidone and olanzapine were associated with the highest quit rates. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that 1) smoking cessation rates with the nicotine transdermal patch are modest in schizophrenia, 2) specialized group therapy for schizophrenic patients is not significantly different from American Lung Association group therapy in its effect on smoking cessation, and 3) atypical agents may be superior to typical agents in combination with the nicotine transdermal patch for smoking cessation in schizophrenia.  
10773774	Exploring the benefits of group psychotherapy in reducing alexithymia in coronary heart disease patients: a preliminary study.	Psychotherapy and psychosomatics	2000	train	7	16	1	Exploring the benefits of group psychotherapy in reducing alexithymia in coronary heart disease patients: a preliminary study.  BACKGROUND: Although there is preliminary evidence that alexithymia may influence the course of coronary heart disease (CHD), there are no studies exploring attempts to modify alexithymic characteristics in cardiac patients. METHOD: Twenty post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients (19 men and 1 woman) were placed in a treatment group, which received weekly group psychotherapy for 4 months. Seventeen post-MI patients (16 men and 1 woman) were placed in a comparison group which received two educational sessions over a period of 1 month. All subjects completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS) before the start of group therapy, at the end of the 4-month period, and in follow-up assessment after 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year intervals. RESULTS: In the psychotherapy treatment group, there was a significant reduction in the mean TAS score following group therapy, which was maintained over the 2-year follow-up period. In the educational group, there were no significant changes in mean TAS scores between the initial testing and any of the follow-up intervals. On an individual basis, a decrease to a lower level of TAS scores occurred in a higher percentage of patients in the treatment group than in the educational group. Over the 2-year follow-up period, patients with decreased alexithymia following group therapy experienced fewer cardiac events (reinfarction, sudden cardiac death, or rehospitalization for rhythm disorder or severe angina) than patients whose alexithymia remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that group psychotherapy is able to decrease alexithymia and that for many patients this change can be maintained for at least 2 years. A reduction in the degree of alexithymia seems to influence favorably the clinical course of CHD.  
23797386	Atherosclerosis and cardiac function assessment in low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice undergoing body weight cycling.	Nutrition & diabetes	2013	train	18	10	5	Atherosclerosis and cardiac function assessment in low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice undergoing body weight cycling.  BACKGROUND: Obesity has become an epidemic in many countries and is supporting a billion dollar industry involved in promoting weight loss through diet, exercise and surgical procedures. Because of difficulties in maintaining body weight reduction, a pattern of weight cycling often occurs (so called 'yo-yo' dieting) that may result in deleterious outcomes to health. There is controversy about cardiovascular benefits of yo-yo dieting, and an animal model is needed to better understand the contributions of major diet and body weight changes on heart and vascular functions. Our purpose is to determine the effects of weight cycling on cardiac function and atherosclerosis development in a mouse model. METHODS: We used low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice due to their sensitivity to metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases when fed high-fat diets. Alternating ad libitum feeding of high-fat and low-fat (rodent chow) diets was used to instigate weight cycling during a 29-week period. Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity tests were done at 22 and 24 weeks, echocardiograms at 25 weeks and atherosclerosis and plasma lipoproteins assessed at 29 weeks. RESULTS: Mice subjected to weight cycling showed improvements in glucose homeostasis during the weight loss cycle. Weight-cycled mice showed a reduction in the severity of atherosclerosis as compared with high-fat diet-fed mice. However, atherosclerosis still persisted in weight-cycled mice as compared with mice fed rodent chow. Cardiac function was impaired in weight-cycled mice and matched with that of mice fed only the high-fat diet. CONCLUSION: This model provides an initial structure in which to begin detailed studies of diet, calorie restriction and surgical modifications on energy balance and metabolic diseases. This model also shows differential effects of yo-yo dieting on metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases.  
25146387	'Change means sacrificing a good life': perceptions about severity of type 2 diabetes and preventive lifestyles among people afflicted or at high risk of type 2 diabetes in Iganga Uganda.	BMC public health	2014	train	10	14	0	'Change means sacrificing a good life': perceptions about severity of type 2 diabetes and preventive lifestyles among people afflicted or at high risk of type 2 diabetes in Iganga Uganda.  BACKGROUND: Interventions for prevention of type 2 diabetes ought to be acceptable to target communities. We assessed perceptions about type 2 diabetes and lifestyle change among people afflicted or at high risk of this disease in a low income setting in Iganga Uganda. METHODS: Twelve focus group discussions (FGDs) of eight participants each were conducted, balancing rural and peri-urban (near the Municipality) residence and gender. The FGDs involved people with suspected type 2 diabetes (based on fasting plasma glucose (FPG), people with suspected pre-diabetes and obese people with normal FPG. Content analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Diabetes was perceived to be a very severe disease. Its severity was attributed to its incurability and its numerous health effects. Men were also concerned about reduced sexual performance. However, participants' strong concerns about the severity of diabetes were not reflected in their perceptions about the risk factors and lifestyles associated with it. While people with diabetes perceive obesity as 'sickness', those without diabetes perceive it as a sign of 'success'. Although participants are willing to change their diet, they mention numerous barriers including poverty, family size, and access to some foods. Because of their good taste, reduction of high risk foods like sugar and fried food is perceived as 'sacrificing a good life'. Increments in physical activity were said to be feasible, but only in familiar forms like domestic work. An over-arching theme emerged that 'lifestyle changes are viewed as sacrificing a good life'. CONCLUSIONS: Health promotion should target both community norms and individual awareness regarding obesity, physical activity and diet, and should address the notion that obesity and unhealthy foods represent a good life. Health educators should plan with clients on how to overcome barriers and misconceptions to lifestyle change, leveraging the pervasive perception of type 2 diabetes as a severe disease to motivate change.

International clinical psychopharmacology	2004	train	13	10	2	Treatment modalities among US children diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: 1995-99.  The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of single and combination treatment modalities among US children aged 5-18 years who were diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Treatments included: (i) stimulant pharmacotherapy alone; (ii) psychotherapy and/or mental health counselling alone; (ii) a combination; or (iv) no treatment. Data from the US National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) for the years 1995-99, were used for this analysis. Office-based physician-patient visits documenting a recorded diagnosis of ADHD (ICD-9-CM codes 314.00 or 314.01) were extracted from the NAMCS. Findings are presented for children diagnosed with ADHD with or without comorbid mental illness, for children diagnosed with ADHD without comorbid mental illness, by gender, and by age groups. Over the timeframe 1995-99, an estimated 14 402 090 office-based visits documented a diagnosis of ADHD, with (24%) or without (76%) comorbid mental illness, among children aged 5-18 years. Overall, the most frequent treatment was stimulant medication alone (42.0%). This was followed by the combination treatment of stimulant medication plus psychotherapy and/or mental health counselling (32.1%). Only 10.8% of the children received psychotherapy and/or mental health counselling alone; 15.1% received no treatment beyond the office-based visit. This pattern was consistent for boys and girls; however, a larger proportion of boys (11.7%) were receiving psychotherapy and/or mental health counselling alone than girls (8.2%). More girls (18.7%) were receiving no treatment option compared to boys (13.9%). The percentage of children receiving psychotherapy and/or mental health counselling alone increased with each age group (6.7%, 5-8 years; 11.3%, 9-12 years; 13.6%, 13-18 years), as did the combination treatment of stimulant medication plus psychotherapy and/or mental health counselling (28.2%, 31%, 37.3%, respectively). Only 8.2% of children age 13-18 years were receiving no treatment option compared to 16.9% of children age 9-12 years, and 19.5% of those aged 5-8 years. The reasons for the gender and age group differences discerned in this study require further investigation, as does the reason why 15.1% of children were receiving no treatment beyond the office-based visit.

Journal of clinical nursing	2018	train	11	11	4	Obesity-risk behaviours and their associations with body mass index (BMI) in Korean American children.  AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe obesity-risk behaviours (diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviour) and examine the relationships of the obesity-risk behaviours with body mass index (BMI) in school-aged Korean American children. BACKGROUND: Korean American children have a risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing obesity-related complications; however, there is limited research about obesity-risk behaviours in Korean American children. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: Obesity-risk behaviours of children were assessed with well-validated self-report questionnaires (i.e., Elementary-level School-based Nutrition Monitoring Questionnaire) from children and their mothers. Height and weight of children were measured. Data were analysed with bivariate and multivariate analyses using mixed effects models to incorporate the correlation within siblings. RESULTS: A total of 170 Korean American children (mean age 10.9 [2.0] years; 52.4% girls; mean BMI 19.3 [3.2]; 28.7% >=85 percentiles) participated in the study. Only 38.3% of Korean American children met established recommendations of five fruits/vegetables per day; 56.5% met recommendations for more than 3 days per week of vigorous physical activity; and 40.8% met recommendations for <2 hr of recreational screen time per day. Sixty per cent and 88.8% of children met the recommendation of sleep on a weekday and weekend, respectively. Only screen time was positively associated with child BMI z-score (beta = 0.08; p < .03). CONCLUSION: Healthcare providers need to be aware of the increased rate of overweight and obesity in Korean American children and initiate clinical interventions to improve obesity-risk behaviours, especially sedentary behaviour, in Korean American children. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Clinical assessment and management of the risk of developing overweight and obesity as well as obesity-related behaviours are important to improve obesity-related complications in overall Korean Americans.

Sleep	2018	train	0	2	0	Cortical and Subcortical Brain Changes in Children and Adolescents With Narcolepsy Type 1.  STUDY OBJECTIVES: Neuroimaging studies on structural alterations in patients with type 1 narcolepsy (NT1) have shown controversial and heterogeneous results. The purpose of this study was to investigate microstructural brain changes in patients with NT1 close to disease onset. METHODS: We examined cortical and subcortical grey matter volumes in 20 drug-naive children and adolescents with NT1 compared with 19 healthy controls; whole-brain voxel-based morphometry, shape and volumetric analyses, and cortical thickness analysis were used. RESULTS: When compared with controls, NT1 patients revealed reduced grey matter volume in cerebellum and medial prefrontal cortex and increased volume in right hippocampus. Cortical thickness in frontal lobe was also reduced in patients compared with controls. Increased volume and shape expansion in right hippocampus in patients compared with controls were also confirmed by both vertex and volumetric analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that subtle structural brain changes involving attentional and limbic circuits are detectable in children and adolescents with NT1. Cerebellum involvement might be related to the childhood NT1 clinical phenotype.  
8560138	Determination of observer-rated alpha activity during sleep.	Sleep	1995	train	5	9	0	Determination of observer-rated alpha activity during sleep.  Patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have been described as having alpha intrusion into sleep. In a separate study of the relationship between depression and CFS, we investigated the sleep of CFS patients. We could not detect any observable alpha anomaly in our group of CFS patients. It is possible that there is a subgroup of CFS patients in whom no alpha anomaly is present. However, the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) montage used in our study was different to that employed by previous researchers. This paper investigates the influence of electrode derivations on the outcome of observable alpha ratings. We compared simultaneous recordings of sleep EEG using three commonly employed montages. Our results indicate that use of the mastoid reference (montage 1) results in the highest observer-related alpha. This may suggest that data regarding alpha intrusion should always be collected using montage 1. However, there is a possibility that the mastoid electrode is not electrically silent and is contaminating the data of the referenced channels. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the validity of alpha intrusion measurement of CFS and fibromyalgia.

The use of biodegraded cashew pomace processed into flour for cake baking was investigated. The physico-chemical changes during the submerged fermentation of the pomace and the organoleptic qualities of the composite cake were also monitored. There was an increase of about 50% in protein content of the pomace after 96 h of fermentation. However, a reduction of about 61% in the total microbial count after 24 h was due to the toxic effect of the organic acids on the microbial cells during fermentation. The cashew flour had high crude fibre (ca. 20-33%) and carbohydrate (ca. 16-47%) values. The composite cake made from a 10:90 combination of 96 h-degraded cashew flour/wheat flour respectively was the most accepted. The cake which had a specific volume of 0.53 ml/g lost 11.1% moisture when 38 g of its batter was exposed to 190 degrees C for 10 minutes. This cake had a calorie value of 293.8/100 g and may be useful in feeding diabetic patients who require low carbohydrate foods.

Circadian rhythm sleep disorders are common conditions manifested as misalignment between the sleep period and the physical/social 24-h environmental cycle. Delayed sleep phase (typical in adolescents) and advanced sleep phase (frequent in the elderly), situations in which the sleep period is displaced to a later or earlier time, respectively, are the two most prevalent circadian rhythm sleep disorders. There are, however, nine possible diagnoses of clinical interest. Since light is the main cue used in synchronizing the biological clock, blind individuals and night-shift/rotating-shift workers are more prone to develop circadian rhythm sleep disorders. In this article, the circadian rhythm syndromes included in the new International Classification of Sleep Disorders are reviewed as well as the most recent guidelines for diagnosis and treatment.

PLoS neglected tropical diseases	2021	train	2	12	0	Rift Valley fever knowledge, mitigation strategies and communication preferences among male and female livestock farmers in Eastern Province, Rwanda.  The Government of Rwanda reported an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the Eastern Province in 2018. To respond to the outbreak, vaccination and education campaigns about the disease were carried out. Because RVF cases continue to be detected in Rwanda and the disease impacts livelihoods and health, accurate knowledge and communication are imperative. The objectives of this study were to evaluate knowledge and risk perceptions of RVF transmission among livestock farmers in Nyagatare District, Eastern Province, Rwanda, and to compare RVF knowledge, risk perceptions, and farming practices between male and female livestock farmers. This cross-sectional, quantitative study was conducted in selected sectors of Nyagatare District in the Eastern Province of Rwanda in June 2019. A 34-question survey was used to ask about demographics, livestock ownership, risk perceptions about zoonotic diseases and livestock management, RVF knowledge, preferred communication sources and information sharing strategies, and protective strategies for RVF mitigation while working with livestock. Livestock farmers were interviewed at three milk collection centers, two village meeting points, a farm cooperative meeting, and during door-to-door visits in villages. In total, 123 livestock farmers were interviewed. The survey found that most livestock farmers lacked knowledge about epizootic and zoonotic transmission of RVF, more male livestock farmers were familiar with RVF and risk mitigation strategies, and female livestock farmers are not viewed as reliable sources of information. Additionally, most livestock farmers had not vaccinated their animals against RVF despite past vaccination campaigns. Radio was the most popular communication channel. These findings show that RVF knowledge and information sharing are inadequate among livestock farmers in Eastern Province. Therefore, vaccination and education campaigns may need to be reevaluated within the context of these trends in order to prepare for future RVF outbreaks.

Carcinogenesis	2017	train	18	10	8	Hair product use and breast cancer risk among African American and White women.  Exposures to carcinogens in hair products have been explored as breast cancer risk factors, yielding equivocal findings. We examined hair product use (hair dyes, chemical relaxers and cholesterol or placenta-containing conditioners) among African American (AA) and White women, and explored associations with breast cancer. Multivariable-adjusted models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to describe the associations of interest among 2280 cases (1508 AA and 772 White) and 2005 controls (1290 AA and 715 White). Among controls, hair dye use was more common among Whites than AAs (58 versus 30%), while relaxer (88 versus 5%) and deep conditioner use (59 versus 6%) was more common among AAs. Among AAs, use of dark hair dye shades was associated with increased breast cancer risk (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.20-1.90) and use of dark shades (OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.30-2.26) and higher frequency of use (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.01-1.84) were associated with ER+ disease. Among Whites, relaxer use (OR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.11-2.74) and dual use of relaxers and hair dyes (OR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.35-4.27) was associated with breast cancer; use of dark hair dyes was associated with increased ER+ disease (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.01-2.33), and relaxer use was associated with increased ER- disease (OR = 2.56, 95% CI: 1.06-6.16). These novel findings provide support a relationship between the use of some hair products and breast cancer. Further examinations of hair products as important exposures contributing to breast cancer carcinogenesis are necessary.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain and rheumatic diseases in subjects over 18 years of age from the canton of Cuenca, Ecuador. Cross-sectional analytical community-based study was conducted in subjects over 18 years of age using the validated Community-Oriented Program for the Control of Rheumatic Diseases (COPCORD) questionnaire. Random sampling was used. The questionnaire was administered by standardized health workers. Subjects were visited house by house. Subjects positive for musculoskeletal (MSK) pain in the last 7 days and at some point in life were assessed by rheumatologists to confirm the diagnosis. A total of 4877 subjects participated, with an average age of 42.8 (SD 18.8) years of age; 59.7 % were women; 69.7 % lived in urban areas. 32.5 % reported MSK pain in the last 7 days and 45.7 % at some point in life. The prevalence of knee osteoarthritis was 7.4 %, hand osteoarthritis 5.3 %, low back pain 9.3 %, rheumatoid arthritis 0.8 %, fibromyalgia 2 %, gout 0.4 %, and lupus 0.06 %. Subjects from rural areas reported experiencing more MSK pain in the last 7 days and at some point in life, lower income, poorer health-care coverage, and increased physical activity involving repetitive tasks such as lifting weights or cooking with firewood. MSK pain prevalence was high. Osteoarthritis and low back pain were the most common diseases. Age, sex, physical activity, repetitive tasks, living in a rural area, and lack of health-care coverage were found to be associated with MSK pain.  
22729623	Occupational benzene exposure and the risk of chronic myeloid leukemia: a meta-analysis of cohort studies incorporating study quality dimensions.	American journal of industrial medicine	2012	train	7	13	4	Occupational benzene exposure and the risk of chronic myeloid leukemia: a meta-analysis of cohort studies incorporating study quality dimensions.  OBJECTIVE: We documented previously that if study quality is accounted for, evidence from occupational cohort studies on benzene supports a possible association with some lymphoma subtypes, in particular multiple myeloma, and acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Here, we extend these analyses to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). METHODS: Three strategies to assess study quality (stratification by the year-of-start of follow-up, stratification by the strength of the reported acute myeloid leukemia (AML) association, and stratification by the quality of benzene exposure assessment) were employed in a meta-analysis of occupational benzene exposure and CML. We hypothesized that stratification by these study quality dimensions would identify a subgroup of occupational cohort studies that is most informative for the evaluation of the possible association between benzene and CML. RESULTS: The overall meta-relative risk (mRR) was non-significantly elevated (1.23; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-1.63). The mRRs increased with increasing study quality for all dimensions with a significant elevation for studies with start of follow-up after 1970 (1.67; 95% CI: 1.02-2.74). The highest study quality stratum for AML significance and exposure quality showed an elevated but non-significant increased mRR (1.40; 95% CI: 0.86-2.27, and 1.68; 95% CI: 0.74-3.84, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by low statistical power, the current meta-analysis provides support for a possible association of occupational exposure to benzene and the risk of CML.

Medycyna pracy	2020	train	9	6	12	Oral cavity status of long-term hemodialized patients vs. their socio-economic status.  BACKGROUND: The chronic kidney disease, blood hypertension and diabetes are recognized as civilization diseases that affect more and more people. The probability of encountering a patient suffering from these diseases is increasing. As such, it appears crucial to better understand the specific dental needs of such groups of patients. The aim of the work was to assess the oral hygiene status and the needs of patients suffering from the end-stage chronic kidney disease, arterial hypertension or/and diabetes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two hundred and twenty eight patients were included in the research. One hundred and eighty patients were hemodialized in Diaverum dialysis stations and 48 patients were from the Conservative Dentistry with Endodontics Clinic of the Academic Centre of Dentistry in Bytom, Silesian Medical University in Katowice, and from the Dentistry Division of the Arnika Clinic in Zabrze, and were not not diagnosed with any of the diseases mentioned. The research scheme was divided into 3 parts, consisting of an analysis of the general health socio-economic status, a survey and an assessment of oral health. RESULTS: The patients who were not suffering from any of the discussed diseases were more aware of how to properly perform hygienic procedures. Most of the patients from both the control and examined groups were not using any rinsing solutions. A higher percentage of patients in the control group was using dental floss, changing their toothbrush every 3 months and brushing their teeth for >=2 min. The Aproximal Plaque Index and the Oral Hygiene Index-Simplified values in the control group were significantly lower in comparison to the examined group. CONCLUSIONS: The socio-economic status of hemodialized patients was low, which in most cases was a result of the difficulties in starting a job. Due to the lower standards of life, the neglect of oral hygiene maintenance and its consequences could be observed. Med Pr. 2020;71(3):279-88.  
1916502	Physical activity at work and duodenal ulcer risk.	Gut	1991	train	16	6	4	Physical activity at work and duodenal ulcer risk.  To determine whether the social class differences in duodenal ulcer frequency may be explained by differences in physical activity at work, the energy expenditure during work, smoking habits, and social class were compared in 76 recently diagnosed duodenal ulcer patients and in age and sex matched community controls. As anticipated, the relative risk of duodenal ulcer showed significant associations with smoking and social class. Social class and physical activity at work were associated with one another. After adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and social class, physically active work was still associated with duodenal ulcer, with relative risks for moderate and high activity compared with sedentary work being 1.3 (0.6-3.0) and 3.6 (1.3-7.8) respectively. Within each social class stratum, the relative risk of having a duodenal ulcer was greater in those with a high level of occupational activity than in those undertaking sedentary work.  
34098233	Exploring the relationship between mastitis risk perceptions and farmers' readiness to engage in milk recording.	Preventive veterinary medicine	2021	train	2	9	0	Exploring the relationship between mastitis risk perceptions and farmers' readiness to engage in milk recording.  The need to move towards Selective Dry Cow Therapy (SDCT) has become increasingly pertinent as a means to reduce the use of antibiotics in the dairy sector. With the EU 2022 ban on prophylactic antibiotics at drying off, practices on some farms will need to drastically change. In Ireland, one particular challenge to the sector-wide transition to SDCT is the lack of widespread uptake of milk recording across dairy farms, a decision support tool which can support mastitis control and help identify cows to select for SDCT. The current study examined readiness to engage in milk recording amongst Irish dairy farmers, and specifically investigated the role of mastitis risk perceptions in shaping farmers' readiness. The study explores the multifaceted nature of risk perception as a construct shaping farmers' attitudes. An online survey was carried out with 197 Irish dairy farmers exploring their attitudes towards mastitis and milk recording. A cluster analysis classified farmers according to their mastitis risk perceptions, with 3 segments identified with differing risk perception profiles. Elevated mastitis risk perceptions were linked to an increased readiness to milk record. However, this relationship was not universal across all farmers. One segment of farmers in the current study maintain low mastitis risk perceptions and remain unmotivated to engage in milk recording. The study concludes that targeted risk communication strategies related to mastitis and milk recording are needed to encourage the move towards SDCT and reduced AMR. Results suggest that the types of risk communication strategies - message framing and two-way risk communication - should reflect farmers' types of mastitis risk perceptions to have the most effective impact on milk recording uptake.

Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)	2020	train	5	9	4	Dietary intake and serum levels of trans fatty acids and risk of breast cancer: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies.  BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although the relationship between dietary intake and serum levels of trans fatty acids and risk of breast cancer has been investigated extensively, findings are inconsistent. To summarize earlier findings on the association of dietary intake and serum levels of trans fatty acids with risk of breast cancer through a dose-response meta-analysis. METHODS: The online databases of PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, Science Direct and Embase were searched for relevant publications up to June 2018, using MeSH and non-MeSH keywords. In total, 7 prospective studies [6 cohort studies and one nested case-control study] were included on total dietary trans fat intake, and five studies [1 cohort study and 4 nested case-control studies] were included about serum trans fatty acids. Assessment of study quality was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Study-specific RRs were combined via fixed-effects model to compute overall RRs. RESULTS: Participants were apparently healthy aged 26 years or older. We observed no significant relationship between dietary intake of total trans fatty acids and risk of breast cancer (pooled effect size: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.95-1.10, P = 0.403). Combining 3 effect sizes from 2 prospective and one nested case-control study, no significant relation was seen between dietary intake of CLA and risk of breast cancer (pooled effect size: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.95-1.17, P = 0.513). Based on 5 effect sizes, each additional 1 g/day dietary intake of total trans fats was not significantly associated with risk of breast cancer (RR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.99-1.01). In addition, it seems that serum levels of trans fats might be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer only among postmenopausal women (Pooled effect size: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.04-1.81, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, dietary intake of trans fatty acids was not associated with risk of breast cancer; however, a significant positive association was seen between serum trans fats and risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.  
12688829	Orbital fractures in sport: a review.	Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)	2003	train	3	5	0	Orbital fractures in sport: a review.  Orbital fractures represent a small proportion of sports-related injuries in the US and abroad. However, the significant functional and cosmetic sequelae of such fractures warrant a comprehensive evaluation of any athlete sustaining facial trauma. Initial evaluation is directed at excluding neurological impairment or the presence of vision-threatening injury. Subsequent examination should ascertain the presence of signs and symptoms consistent with orbital fracture. These include gross bony deformity, limitation of gaze, diplopia and malposition of the globe. The presence of any of the aforementioned symptoms should prompt further investigation using computed tomography to corroborate or refute clinical suspicion. Orbital fracture mandates referral to an ophthalmologist or oculoplastic surgeon; initial management is dictated by the severity of functional symptoms, and may necessitate early surgical intervention. Those patients who are managed conservatively should return for frequent follow-up, as progressive diplopia, enophthalmos, or gaze limitation are indications for late operative repair. The majority of patients who sustain orbital fractures are able to return to sport, however, persistent diplopia is not uncommon, and may persist despite optimal treatment.  
20461307	[Morbidity in postmenopausal women with poverty].	Revista medica de Chile	2010	train	19	11	3	[Morbidity in postmenopausal women with poverty].  BACKGROUND: Less favored social classes usually have more unhealthy life-styles and a more difficult access to Health Resources. AIM: To study the possible association between poverty and some common diseases, in a population of postmenopausal women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four hundred and forty nine poor women aged 56 +/- 12 years and 776 consecutive women aged 53 +/- 12 years, answered a personal interview about their lifestyles and medications used. Their medical records were reviewed and they were subjected to a complete physical examination, including weight and height measurement. A fasting blood sample was also obtained. Poverty was defined according to criteria of the Spanish National Institute of Statistics that is based on the income in Euros and the number of family members that share such income. RESULTS: A higher proportion of poor women live in rural areas. They were shorter, had a higher weight and thus a higher body mass index, smoked less and drank less alcohol than their non-poor counterparts drink. The consumption of caffeine, the actual calcium intake and the physical activity during leisure time was similar in both groups. Compared with their counterparts, poor women had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (15.9 and 10.1% respectively, p = < 0.01), obesity (44.2 and 24.3% respectively, p < 0.01) hypertension (24.3 and 16.4%o respectively, p<0.01) and autoimmune rheumatic diseases (7.8 and 4.8% > respectively, p = 0.03). A multiple logistic regression model showed that obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcohol consumption and living in rural areas, were independently associated to poverty. CONCLUSIONS: Poor postmenopausal women have a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, obesity, autoimmune rheumatic diseases and hypertension and lower frequency of smoking and alcohol consumption than their affluent counterparts do.

PURPOSE: A meta-analysis on sleep duration and patterns in patients with diabetes in China. DESIGN AND METHODS: Two investigators independently carried out a systematic literature search in both international and Chinese databases. FINDINGS: A total of 47 studies with 98 911 patients were included. The pooled mean sleep duration was 7.15 hours/day in patients with diabetes and 7.49 hours/day in healthy controls. The estimated percentage of short sleep duration of less than 6 hours/day was 23.0% in patients with diabetes and 12.3% in healthy controls, while the proportion of short sleep duration of less than 7 hours/day was 38.0% in patients with diabetes and 14.1% in healthy controls. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Short sleep duration was common in Chinese patients with diabetes.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of multiheaded condyles (MHC) in a group of Turkish subjects using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). METHODS: In this retrospective study, CBCT scans of 975 patients (546 female, 429 male; age 15-89 years, mean age 42.46 years) who were referred to Istanbul University Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Dentomaxillofacial Radiology between 2015 and 2021 were evaluated. Bifid and trifid mandibular condyle cases were analyzed according to the patients' age, gender, and laterality, and their frequencies were determined statistically. RESULTS: A multiheaded mandibular condyle (MHC) was detected in 57 of the 975 patients (546 female, 429 male). MHC was diagnosed unilaterally in 49 patients; in 8 patients, it was observed bilaterally. A bifid mandibular condyle (BMC) was detected in 54 patients. A trifid mandibular condyle (TMC) was found in 2 women, and one tetrafid mandibular condyle was seen in 1 woman. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MHC was 5.84% in our proband, which is higher than in previous studies. There was no statistically significant difference between the prevalence of MHC in males or females.

Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (1995)	2000	train	10	0	0	Inhalation transfer factors for air pollution health risk assessment.  To facilitate routine health risk assessments, we develop the concept of an inhalation transfer factor (ITF). The ITF is defined as the pollutant mass inhaled by an exposed individual per unit pollutant mass emitted from an air pollution source. A cumulative population inhalation transfer factor (PITF) is also defined to describe the total fraction of an emitted pollutant inhaled by all members of the exposed population. In this paper, ITFs and PITFs are calculated for outdoor releases from area, point, and line sources, indoor releases in single zone and multizone indoor environments, and releases within motor vehicles. Typical PITFs for an urban area from emissions outdoors are approximately 10(-6)-10(-3). PITFs associated with emissions in buildings or in moving vehicles are typically much higher, approximately 10(-3)-10(-1).

International journal of behavioral medicine	2020	train	18	11	8	Self-Reported Sleep and Exercise Patterns in Patients with Schizophrenia: a Cross-Sectional Comparative Study.  BACKGROUND: Adequate sleep and physical activity have been linked to the overall well-being of both medical and psychiatric patients. Patients with schizophrenia have shown abnormal sleep patterns and decreased physical activity that were linked to their psychopathology and physical health. These phenomena are not studied yet in Arab patients with schizophrenia. The purpose of this study is to study the sleep and exercise patterns in Arab patients with schizophrenia compared with those of healthy controls. METHOD: A total of 99 patients with schizophrenia and 101 controls were recruited. Arabic versions of sleep, exercise, socio-demographic, and clinical questionnaires were administered as well as the validated scales to measure psychopathology, depression, and suicidality in these participants. RESULTS: The majority of patients with schizophrenia slept more than 8 h per day and exercised less when compared with controls. Sleep quality was worse in those with higher depression score and higher suicidality scores were seen in patients with lower sleep duration. Multinomial regression showed that patients with schizophrenia have higher odds of sleeping more than 8 h even after controlling for the intake of antipsychotics, age, gender, smoking status, and other confounding factors. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that Arab patients with schizophrenia are at increased risk of having longer sleep duration with inadequate physical activity, which are correlating with worsening of depressive symptoms and suicidality. Thus, more attention should be paid to the changes in sleep patterns and level of exercise when treating Arab patients with schizophrenia.

BMC obesity	2017	train	12	10	7	Childhood overweight, obesity and associated factors among primary school children in dire dawa, eastern Ethiopia; a cross-sectional study.  BACKGROUND: Obesity in children is increasing worldwide. Malnutrition has become a double burden challenge of public health concern in developing countries. Childhood obesity increases the risk of chronic disease in childhood as well as adulthood. However, information is very scarce about childhood obesity in developing countries specifically in Ethiopia. Therefore, we aimed to assess childhood overweight, obesity and associated factors among primary school children at Dire Dawa, Eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: A school based cross-sectional study was conducted in Dire Dawa from 1(st) to 30(th) March, 2016. Study participants were selected using multistage sampling method. Pre-tested self-administered questionnaire, face to face interview technique and anthropometric measurements were used to collect data by eight well trained data collectors. Data were coded, cleaned and entered into EpiData software version 3.5.1, and exported into SPSS (version 21.0) statistical software, for data analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were carried out to identify associated factors with childhood overweight and obesity. Statistical significance was declared using Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) at 95% CI and p-value less than 0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence of overweight and obesity were 14.7% (95% CI: 11.7, 18.0) and 5.8% (95% CI: 3.6, 8.0), respectively. Children who were from private school (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.4, 8.5), from families belonged to high socioeconomic class (AOR = 16.9, 95% CI: 6.5, 23.9), preferred sweetened foods (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.1), had not engaged in regular physical exercise (AOR = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.5, 9.8), had experienced sedentary life style like spent their free time watching TV (AOR = 3.6, 95% CI: 1.6, 7.9), play computer game (AOR = 4.6, 95% CI:1.4,15.4), and were not having close friends (AOR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.4, 6.2) were significantly associated with overweight/obesity risk. CONCLUSION: Overweight/obesity in children is on alarming stage in the study area. Therefore, more attention should be given to creating awareness about healthy diet and improving life style through school and public media in collaboration with concerned bodies.

Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition	2014	train	7	6	1	Prevalence of malnutrition in patients admitted to a major urban tertiary care hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam.  OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of malnutrition using anthropometric measures among hospitalized pediatric and adult patients admitted at Bach Mai Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam. METHODS: A one-day cross-sectional survey was used in selected wards (Pediatrics, Surgery, Intensive Care Unit, Renal Diseases, Gastroenterology Diseases, Respiratory Diseases, and Endocrinology). Unavailable patients and those discharged within 24 hours were excluded. Anthropometric data included body weight, height (or length), and mid-upper arm circumference. The type, severity, and prevalence rate of malnutrition were defined based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. RESULTS: The sample was hospitalized children and adults: 108 and 571 were children aged 6 months to 18.9 years old and adult patients, respectively. The overall rate of pediatric wasting (weight-for-height <= -2 SD or BMI <= -2 SD, kg/m(2)) was 19.0% (n= 19/100) and that of stunting (height-for-age <= -2 SD) was 13.9% (n=14/101). Using either the mid-upper arm circumference <11.5 cm or the weight-for-height and weight-for-length <= -3 SD, the rate of severe wasting among children aged 6-59 months old was 7.0% (n=3/43). None of the children were obese based on weight-for-length, weight-for-height, or BMI. In adults, the prevalence of under-nutrition (BMI<18.5 kg/m(2)) was 33.3% (n=141/423) while that of obesity (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2)) was 0.9% (n=4/423). Adults admitted to the Respiratory Diseases ward had the highest prevalence of under-nutrition, 40.9% (n=38/93). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of malnutrition was high in this cohort of hospitalized patients, particularly in adults, but comparable to other published reports. Obesity was nearly nonexistent in both children and adults.  
29905514	Epidemiology of central nervous system infectious diseases: a meta-analysis and systematic review with implications for neurosurgeons worldwide.	Journal of neurosurgery	2019	train	8	18	2	Epidemiology of central nervous system infectious diseases: a meta-analysis and systematic review with implications for neurosurgeons worldwide.  OBJECTIVECentral nervous system (CNS) infections cause significant morbidity and mortality and often require neurosurgical intervention for proper diagnosis and treatment. However, neither the international burden of CNS infection, nor the current capacity of the neurosurgical workforce to treat these diseases is well characterized. The objective of this study was to elucidate the global incidence of surgically relevant CNS infection, highlighting geographic areas for targeted improvement in neurosurgical capacity.METHODSA systematic literature review and meta-analysis were performed to capture studies published between 1990 and 2016. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched using variations of terms relating to CNS infection and epidemiology (incidence, prevalence, burden, case fatality, etc.). To deliver a geographic breakdown of disease, results were pooled using the random-effects model and stratified by WHO region and national income status for the different CNS infection types.RESULTSThe search yielded 10,906 studies, 154 of which were used in the final qualitative analysis. A meta-analysis was performed to compute disease incidence by using data extracted from 71 of the 154 studies. The remaining 83 studies were excluded from the quantitative analysis because they did not report incidence. A total of 508,078 cases of CNS infections across all studies were included, with a total sample size of 130,681,681 individuals. Mean patient age was 35.8 years (range: newborn to 95 years), and the male/female ratio was 1:1.74. Among the 71 studies with incidence data, 39 were based in high-income countries, 25 in middle-income countries, and 7 in low-income countries. The pooled incidence of studied CNS infections was consistently highest in low-income countries, followed by middle- and then high-income countries. Regarding WHO regions, Africa had the highest pooled incidence of bacterial meningitis (65 cases/100,000 people), neurocysticercosis (650/100,000), and tuberculous spondylodiscitis (55/100,000), whereas Southeast Asia had the highest pooled incidence of intracranial abscess (49/100,000), and Europe had the highest pooled incidence of nontuberculous vertebral spondylodiscitis (5/100,000). Overall, few articles reported data on deaths associated with infection. The limited case fatality data revealed the highest case fatality for tuberculous meningitis/spondylodiscitis (21.1%) and the lowest for neurocysticercosis (5.5%). In all five disease categories, funnel plots assessing for publication bias were asymmetrical and suggested that the results may underestimate the incidence of disease.CONCLUSIONSThis systematic review and meta-analysis approximates the global incidence of neurosurgically relevant infectious diseases. These results underscore the disproportionate burden of CNS infections in the developing world, where there is a tremendous demand to provide training and resources for high-quality neurosurgical care.

Cancer investigation	2000	train	10	21	2	Use of hair dyes, hematopoietic neoplasms, and lymphomas: a literature review. II. Lymphomas and multiple myeloma.  We review studies on hair dyes and lymphomas and multiple myeloma (MM). A computerized literature search for the years 1966 through 1996 was conducted. Data were extracted using a standardized form that recorded study design, study population, type of cases, comparison group, sources of data on personal exposure to hair dyes, method of data collection, type of exposure data collected, covariates, and results. This review identified 10 epidemiologic studies published in the English literature that examined personal use of hair dyes and lymphomas or MM. These studies include three evaluations of Hodgkin's disease, five of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), two of lymphomas with type not specified, and six of MM. For Hodgkin's disease, one case-control study reported some positive associations with use of permanent hair dyes, whereas two cohort studies found no associations with ever use of hair dyes. For NHL and MM, several evaluations suggest associations with use of permanent dyes, particularly with duration, frequency, age at first use, and dark colors. However, these associations are not consistent within and between studies. For lymphomas with type not specified, one study was superseded by a more recent report with NHL specific data and a second study was limited by small numbers of exposed subjects. At this time, it is not possible to determine if the inconsistent associations between permanent hair dyes and NHL and MM reflect sampling variability or differences in methods between studies. Because an appreciable fraction of the population has potential exposure to permanent hair dyes, elucidation of such issues may be warranted with studies that include adequate numbers of exposed subjects and that elicit information on personal use of hair dyes over time.

Diabetologia	2013	train	9	7	3	Long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution and diabetes-associated mortality: a cohort study.  AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to investigate whether air pollution from traffic at a residence is associated with mortality related to type 1 or type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We followed up 52,061 participants in the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort for diabetes-related mortality in the nationwide Register of Causes of Death, from baseline in 1993-1997 up to the end of 2009, and traced their residential addresses since 1971 in the Central Population Registry. We used dispersion-modelled concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) since 1971 and amount of traffic at the baseline residence as indicators of traffic-related air pollution and used Cox regression models to estimate mortality-rate ratios (MRRs) with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: Mean levels of NO2 at the residence since 1971 were significantly associated with mortality from diabetes. Exposure above 19.4 mug/m(3) (upper quartile) was associated with a MRR of 2.15 (95% CI 1.21, 3.83) when compared with below 13.6 mug/m(3) (lower quartile), corresponding to an MRR of 1.31 (95% CI 0.98, 1.76) per 10 mug/m(3) NO2 after adjustment for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that traffic-related air pollution is associated with mortality from diabetes. If confirmed, reduction in population exposure to traffic-related air pollution could be an additional strategy against the global public health burden of diabetes.  
28559087	Not only limbs in atypical restless legs syndrome.	Sleep medicine reviews	2018	train	0	11	0	Not only limbs in atypical restless legs syndrome.  Restless legs syndrome (RLS) typically affects the limbs, but the involvement of other body parts has also been reported. In this essay, we critically review all literature reports of atypical RLS cases with unusual localizations. Applying the updated diagnostic criteria of the International restless legs syndrome study group (IRLSSG), which also consider symptoms localized outside of the lower limbs, a few of these atypical cases reported in the previous literature resulted in a definitive diagnosis of RLS. We also discuss the relationship between RLS and burning mouth syndrome (BMS) or restless genital syndrome (RGS). We conclude clinical sleep specialists should be aware of unusual RLS localizations because they respond to the usual treatment for RLS. All the IRLSSG diagnostic criteria should be applied in every suspected case, in order to establish a correct diagnosis of this disabling but treatable condition.

Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health	2002	train	7	9	0	[End-stage renal disease among patients in a referral hospital in El Salvador].  OBJECTIVE: El Salvador is a country with high mortality from end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The objective of this study was to determine the epidemiological characteristics of a series of new cases of ESRD seen in a referral hospital in the country. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted of all the new cases that initiated chronic dialysis between November 1999 and March 2000. Using a personal interview, data were obtained on the patients' clinical, demographic, and occupational characteristics, among others. RESULTS: During the five months that the study lasted, 205 new cases of ESRD were observed. Among the 202 interviewees, two groups were clearly distinguished. One group, of 67 patients (33%), had known risk factors for ESRD, similar to those for developed countries (basically, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories). Another group of 135 patients (67%) had unusual characteristics that were not associated with the known risk factors. The majority of the patients in this second group were male, farmers, residents of coastal areas or areas next to rivers, and some years before had been exposed, without adequate protection, to agricultural insecticides or pesticides through their work. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified an important group of patients with ESRD who seem to lack a cause for their disease. Their special characteristics make it possible to suspect a relationship with the occupational exposure to insecticides or pesticides. New studies are needed in order to confirm this hypothesis.

The elevated OR for chronic lymphatic leukemia among farmers was statistically significant (OR = 1.67), while elevated ORs for acute lymphatic leukemia (OR = 1.34), acute monocytic leukemia (OR = 1.94), and acute unspecified leukemia (OR = 2.36) were not. Farmers who died at younger ages or who were born in more recent years were at greater risk of acute lymphatic, acute myeloid, chronic myeloid, acute unspecified, and unspecified leukemia than other farmers. Certain cell types were related to agricultural characteristics of the subject's county of residence, although few were statistically significant. Farmers from counties with large cattle inventories and significant dairy activity were at higher risk of chronic lymphatic leukemia. Farmers from major corn-producing, hog- and chicken-raising, and pesticide- and fertilizer-using counties tended to be at higher risk of acute lymphatic, acute myeloid, chronic myeloid, and acute unspecified leukemia than farmers from counties less involved in the production or use of these agricultural factors.  
19489195	The pool chlorine hypothesis and asthma among boys.	Irish medical journal	2009	train	12	8	5	"The pool chlorine hypothesis and asthma among boys.  Swimming pool sanitation has largely been concerned with the microbiological quality of pool water, which is normally treated using a number of chlorine products. Recent studies have pointed to the potential hazards of chlorine by-products to the respiratory epithelium, particularly in indoor, poorly ventilated, pools. The aim of our study was to elucidate whether chronic exposure to indoor chlorinated swimming pools was associated with an increased likelihood of the development of asthma in boys. METHODS: The subjects were boys aged between 6 and 12 years. Data was collected by means of parental responses to a standardized asthma questionnaire (ISAAC: International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood), supplemented with additional questions regarding frequency of attendance, number of years attendance, whether the child is a swimming team member. The questionnaire return rate was 71/% (n = 121). 23 boys were excluded on the basis that they had asthma before they started swimming (n = 97). There was a significant association between number of years a boy had been swimming and the likelihood of wheezing in the last 12 months (p = 0.009; OR = 1.351; 95% CI = 1.077-1.693) and diagnosed asthma (p = 0.046; OR = 1.299; 95% CI = 1.004-1.506). The greater the number the number of years a boy had been attending an indoor, chlorinated pool, the greater the likelihood of wheezing in the last 12 months or ""had asthma"". Age, parental smoking habits and being a swimming team member had no association with any of the asthma variables examined. Swimming pool attendance may be a risk factor in asthma in boys.  "
6892288	SCAN: a method of community collaboration.	Child abuse & neglect	1982	train	4	0	0	SCAN: a method of community collaboration.  Recent research has highlighted the complexity of the battered child syndrome. Clinical experience suggests that treatment of troubled families is a long-term process, draining financial resources of agencies and emotional resources of professionals. The need to provide support and case consultation to professionals working in the area of child abuse and neglect evolved in the establishment, in 1968, of the Suspected Child Abuse and Neglect (SCAN) Program at Children's Hospital, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This program provides an effective method of intervention through identification, consultation, referral and follow-up of at-risk families. Weekly meetings offer multi-disciplinary case coordination, treatment recommendations, and a channel of communication for representatives of community agencies. This paper traces the history and present status of the SCAN Program, as well as the role of SCAN as a force for change of community attitudes.  
26631015	Oral health and HIV infection among female sex workers in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.	BMC oral health	2015	train	8	17	1	Oral health and HIV infection among female sex workers in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.  BACKGROUND: Worldwide, female sex workers (FSW) represent a vulnerable population for oral diseases due to many risk factors including HIV infection and drug abuse. In sub-Saharan Africa, little is known about the burden of oral diseases and their determinants in vulnerable populations. The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence and associated factors of oral diseases among FSW. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted among FSW who attended a dedicated non-profit clinic in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire from June to August 2013. Data about the presence of dental caries, periodontitis and oral-mucosal lesions were collected by a dentist during an oral examination. Behavioural information related to oral hygiene habits as well as tobacco and alcohol consumption were collected through a standardized questionnaire. Information related to HIV infection including HIV diagnosis, last known CD4 count and antiretroviral therapy were documented through a medical chart review. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with oral diseases. RESULTS: A total of 249 FSW with a median age of 29 years, [Inter Quartile Range (IQR) = 23-36] and a median duration of sex work of 24 months [IQR 9-60]) were included. Current tobacco use and hazardous alcohol use were reported in 21.7 % and 19.7 % of FSW, respectively. The estimated prevalence of HIV infection was 33.7 % [95 % confidence interval (CI); 27.8 - 39.6]) and 82.1 % of HIV-infected FSW were on antiretroviral therapy . The prevalence of dental caries, periodontitis and oral-mucosal lesions were 62.3 % [95 % CI 55.5 - 67.5], 14.5 % [95 % CI 10.2 - 18.9] and 8.2 % [95 % CI 4.8 - 11.5], respectively. In multivariate analysis, periodontitis, oral-mucosal lesions and HIV infection were associated with odds ratio of 2.6 [95 % CI, 1.2-5.8]) and 50.0 [95 % CI; 6.4-384.6]. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high prevalence of oral diseases among FSW in Abidjan. HIV infection was common and significantly associated with periodontal diseases and oral-mucosal lesions. There is a need to integrate regular screening and treatment of oral lesions into the medical follow-up of FSW along with strategies for HIV prevention.  
31904736	Gender Differences in Hypertension Treatment and Control in Young Adults.	The journal of nursing research : JNR	2020	train	8	13	8	Gender Differences in Hypertension Treatment and Control in Young Adults.  BACKGROUND: Compared with older adults, young adults exhibit poor treatment and control of hypertension. However, little is known about the factors affecting the treatment and control of hypertension in young adults. PURPOSE: This study was aimed to identify the factors affecting the treatment and control of hypertension in early adulthood by gender in South Korea. METHODS: This secondary data analysis study used a data set from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) 19-44 years old and (b) having an indicator of hypertension (systolic blood pressure >= 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure >= 90 mmHg, or taking antihypertensive drugs). Seven hundred eighty participants were included in this study. The odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were derived using composite-sample multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: In men, age, marital status, family history of hypertension, treatment of hyperlipidemia, abdominal obesity, high-sodium diet, cholesterol, and aerobic exercise were found to be associated with hypertension treatment and control. In women, age, employment status, cardiovascular risk factors, body mass index, high-sodium diet, and drinking were found to be associated with hypertension treatment and control. CONCLUSIONS: The factors affecting the treatment and control of hypertension differed between the two genders. Therefore, healthcare providers should consider the differences in the factors between the two genders in early adulthood. To improve the treatment and control of hypertension, the guidelines for treatment interventions and management should be gender-specific from early adulthood. Nurses should actively suggest health-related behavioral modifications such as performing aerobic exercise for young adult men and reducing alcohol consumption for women.  
21369953	Silicone breast implants and connective tissue disease: no association.	Seminars in immunopathology	2011	train	8	16	6	"Silicone breast implants and connective tissue disease: no association.  The association of silicone breast implants with connective tissue diseases (CTDs), including systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and fibromyalgia, as well as a hypothesized new ""atypical"" disease, which does not meet established diagnostic criteria for any known CTD, has been extensively studied. We have reviewed the epidemiologic literature regarding an association between cosmetic breast implants and CTDs, with particular emphasis on results drawn from the most recent investigations, many of which are large cohort studies with long-term follow-up, as well as on those studies that address some of the misinformation and historically widespread claims regarding an association between breast implants and CTDs. These claims have been unequivocally refuted by the remarkably consistent evidence from published studies, as well as numerous independent meta-analyses and critical reviews, which have demonstrated that cosmetic breast implants are not associated with a subsequent increased occurrence of individual CTDs or all CTDs combined, including fibromyalgia. Moreover, there is no credible evidence for the conjectured excess of ""atypical"" CTD among women with cosmetic breast implants, or of a rheumatic symptom profile unique to these women. No increased risk of CTDs is evident in women with extracapsular ruptures in two studies, which evaluated risk by implant rupture status, and no consistent association has been observed between silicone breast implants and a variety of serologic markers or autoantibodies. Thus, any claims that remain regarding an association between cosmetic breast implants and CTDs are not supported by the scientific literature but rather are a residual byproduct of the unprecedented large-scale product liability litigation in the USA.

In this Early Career Award paper, the interplay between quantitative and qualitative approaches to self-awareness in the psychotherapy literature is described. In addition, the linkages between therapist self-awareness and self-focused attention discussed in the cognitive and social psychology literatures are also addressed. Contradictory sets of findings are examined; for example, momentary states of therapist self-awareness have at times been associated with anxiety or poor performance and at other times with positive interpersonal processes and client perceptions. Some of the studies on the management of distracting self-awareness are also reviewed, and suggestions for future research in the areas of mindfulness, attentional flexibility, and the person of the therapist are provided.

The presence of a time limit shapes the entire therapeutic process and culminates in the management of termination. This paper outlines a protocol for dealing with termination in time-limited psychotherapy groups: (1) Select suitable members with similar capacity to use a time-limited format; (2) use a closed group format; (3) clarify the time boundaries at the beginning; (4) reinforce the time frame during the last half of the group; (5) provide focused interventions; (6) forestall premature termination; (7) reinforce termination themes of deprivation, resentment and anger, rejection, grief and loss, responsibility for self; (8) structure the final session; and (9) plan a 4-month follow-up visit to encourage ongoing application. These guidelines provide the therapist with a general structure to ensure that major termination themes are systematically addressed. They deal with powerful concepts of maturation and self-responsibility and incorporate the principal strategies that distinguish time-limited from time-unlimited group psychotherapy.

Reproductive health	2018	train	20	12	4	Antenatal tobacco use and iron deficiency anemia: integrating tobacco control into antenatal care in urban India.  BACKGROUND: In India, tobacco use during pregnancy is not routinely addressed during antenatal care. We measured the association between tobacco use and anemia in low-income pregnant women, and identified ways to integrate tobacco cessation into existing antenatal care at primary health centers. METHODS: We conducted an observational study using structured interviews with antenatal care clinic patients (n = 100) about tobacco use, anemia, and risk factors such as consumption of iron rich foods and food insecurity. We performed blood tests for serum cotinine, hemoglobin and ferritin. We conducted in-depth interviews with physicians (n = 5) and auxiliary nurse midwives (n = 5), and focus groups with community health workers (n = 65) to better understand tobacco and anemia control services offered during antenatal care. RESULTS: We found that 16% of patients used tobacco, 72% were anemic, 41% had iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and 29% were food insecure. Regression analysis showed that tobacco use (OR = 14.3; 95%CI = 2.6, 77.9) and consumption of green leafy vegetables (OR = 0.6; 95%CI = 0.4, 0.9) were independently associated with IDA, and tobacco use was not associated with consumption of iron-rich foods or household food insecurity. Clinics had a system for screening, treatment and follow-up care for anemic and iron-deficient antenatal patients, but not for tobacco use. Clinicians and community health workers were interested in integrating tobacco screening and cessation services with current maternal care services such as anemia control. Tobacco users wanted help to quit. CONCLUSION: It would be worthwhile to assess the feasibility of integrating antenatal tobacco screening and cessation services with antenatal care services for anemia control, such as screening and guidance during clinic visits and cessation support during home visits.

The Cochrane database of systematic reviews	2016	train	20	10	0	Low bacterial diet versus control diet to prevent infection in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy causing episodes of neutropenia.  BACKGROUND: Neutropenia is a potentially serious side effect of chemotherapy and a major risk factor for infection, which can be life-threatening. It has been hypothesised that a low bacterial diet (LBD) can prevent infection and (infection-related) mortality in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy that causes episodes of neutropenia, but much remains unclear. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this review was to determine the efficacy of an LBD versus a control diet in preventing infection and in decreasing (infection-related) mortality in adult and paediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy that causes episodes of neutropenia. Secondary objectives were to assess time to first febrile episode, need for empirical antibiotic therapy, diet acceptability and quality of life. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 4), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (2015, Issue 4), PubMed (from 1946 to 4 May 2015), EMBASE (from 1980 to 4 May 2015) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (from 1981 to 4 May 2015).In addition, we searched the reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings of American Society of Hematology (ASH; from 2000 to 2015), European Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT; from 2000 to 2015), Oncology Nurses Society (ONS; from 2000 to 2015), International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP; from 2000 to 2014), Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC; from 2000 to 2015), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO; from 2000 to 2015), Interscience Conference of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC; from 2000 to 2015), European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN; from 2000 to 2015), American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN; from 2000 to 2015) and European Hematology Association (EHA; from 2000 to 2015). In May 2015, we scanned the National Institutes of Health Register via clinicaltrials.gov and the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) Register (www.controlled-trials.com). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing use of an LBD versus a control diet with regard to infection rate, (infection-related) mortality, time to first febrile episode, need for empirical antibiotic therapy, diet acceptability and quality of life in adult and paediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy causing episodes of neutropenia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. We performed analyses according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. MAIN RESULTS: In the original version of this review, we identified three RCTs that assessed different intervention and control diets in 192 participants (97 randomised to intervention diet; 95 to control diet) with different types of malignancies. For the update, we identified no eligible new studies. Co-interventions (e.g. protective environment, antimicrobial prophylaxis, central venous catheter care, oral care, hygiene practices, colony-stimulating factors) and outcome definitions also differed between studies. In all included studies, it was standard policy to give empirical antibiotics (and sometimes also antimycotics) to (some of) the participants diagnosed with an infection. Two studies included adults and one study included children. In all studies, only a scant description of treatment regimens was provided. All studies had methodological limitations. Pooling of results of included studies was not possible. In two individual studies, no statistically significant differences in infection rate were identified between intervention and control diets; another study showed no significant differences between treatment groups in the number of chemotherapy cycles with an infection. None of the studies mentioned infection-related mortality, but in one study, no significant difference in overall survival was observed between treatment groups. Time from onset of neutropenia to fever, duration of empirical antibiotics and antimycotics, diet acceptability (i.e. following the diet easily and following the diet throughout all chemotherapy cycles) and quality of life were all evaluated by only one study; for all outcomes, no statistically significant differences between treatment arms were identified. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: At the moment, no evidence from individual RCTs in children and adults with different malignancies underscores use of an LBD for prevention of infection and related outcomes. All studies differed with regard to co-interventions, outcome definitions and intervention and control diets. As pooling of results was not possible, and as all studies had serious methodological limitations, we could reach no definitive conclusions. It should be noted that 'no evidence of effect', as identified in this review, is not the same as 'evidence of no effect'. On the basis of currently available evidence, we are not able to provide recommendations for clinical practice. Additional high-quality research is needed.

BACKGROUND: The promotion of physical activity among imprisoned people is a public health strategy that could help to improve the health status of this collective. This systematic review is aimed at reviewing the scientific evidence regarding the effects of exercise training programs performed by inmates. METHODS: A systematic search for randomized controlled trials aimed at identifying the characteristics and effects of prison-based exercise training programs on imprisoned people was carried through MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, and Scopus. RESULTS: A total of 11 randomized controlled studies were selected, and the methodological quality of these was acceptable according to the Downs and Black scale. The proposed interventions were mainly based on the performance of aerobic or combined exercise training programs. Generally, the participants were healthy men who were imprisoned for at least 2 months and up to 15 years. Ten out of the 11 studies reported significant changes on physical and mental health-related variables, after the intervention took place. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that prison-based exercise programs constitute a feasible and useful strategy for improving the physical and mental health status of prisoners.

AIM: To examine the effects of inactive periods of force on the amount of tooth displacement and root resorption during experimental tooth movement in rats. SAMPLE: Sixty 11-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. METHOD: The maxillary first molar (M1) was moved mesially using a removable titanium-nickel alloy closed coil spring for 14 days. The rats were divided into four groups with, 0, 1, 4, and 9 hours of inactivation per day. RESULTS: Tooth displacement in the 0- and 1-hour groups was significantly greater than that in the 9-hour group. The area of root resorption in the 4- and 9-hour groups was significantly less than that in the 0- and 1-hour groups. There was no significant difference in root resorption between 0- and 1-hour groups, and also between 4- and 9-hour groups. CONCLUSION: The distance of tooth displacement gradually decreased as the inactive period increased, whereas root resorption suddenly decreased between 1 and 4 hours of inactive orthodontic force.

Nutrients	2020	train	15	8	1	The Impact of FTO Genetic Variants on Obesity and Its Metabolic Consequences is Dependent on Daily Macronutrient Intake.  Numerous studies have identified the various fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) genetic variants associated with obesity and its metabolic consequences; however, the impact of dietary factors on these associations remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between FTO single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), daily macronutrient intake, and obesity and its metabolic consequences. From 1549 Caucasian subjects of Polish origin, genotyped for the FTO SNPs (rs3751812, rs8044769, rs8050136, and rs9939609), 819 subjects were selected for gene-diet interaction analysis. Anthropometric measurements were performed and total body fat content and distribution, blood glucose and insulin concentration during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and lipid profile were determined. Macronutrient intake was analyzed based on three-day food records, and daily physical activity levels were evaluated using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Long Form (IPAQ-LF). Our study shows that carriers of the GG genotype of rs3751812 presented lower body weight, body mass index (BMI), total body fat content, and hip and waist circumference and presented lower obesity-related markers if more than 48% of daily energy intake was derived from carbohydrates and lower subcutaneous and visceral fat content when energy intake derived from dietary fat did not exceed 30%. Similar results were observed for rs8050136 CC genotype carriers. We did not notice any significant differences in obesity markers between genotypes of rs8044769, but we did observe a significant impact of diet-gene associations. Body weight and BMI were significantly higher in TT and CT genotype carriers if daily energy intake derived from carbohydrates was less than 48%. Moreover, in TT genotype carriers, we observed higher blood glucose concentration while fasting and during the OGTT test if more than 18% of total energy intake was derived from proteins. In conclusion, our results indicate that daily macronutrient intake may modulate the impact of FTO genetic SNPs on obesity and obesity-related metabolic consequences.

The aims of this study were to assess the functional level of women with fibromyalgia; to investigate the differences in the occupational activities between women with fibromyalgia and healthy women; and to analyse the perceived importance of occupational performance during self-care, productivity and leisure activities. A cross-sectional case control study was performed. Twenty women with fibromyalgia and 20 healthy women completed the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), a Numerical Pain Rating Scale, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and the SF-36 health survey. The Chi-square test (chi2), the Student's t test and the Spearman's test were used on the data. The FIM revealed significant differences regarding several activities: personal hygiene, bathing and memory (p < 0.01). The COPM scores did not reveal significant differences between groups (p > 0.10). Women with fibromyalgia had higher disability and reduced quality of life and required greater assistance to perform specific activities of daily living, i.e. hygiene, than healthy women. This highlights the specific occupational therapy needs these women have for performing many basic activities and for improving their quality of life. Limitations of the study include the small sample size, the exclusion of male participants and the possible influence of the women's psychological status on the assessments performed. Findings should be generalized with caution. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of walking at self-selected speed on an active workstation on cognitive performance. METHODS: Sixty-six participants (n = 27 males, 39 females; mean age = 21.06 +/- 1.6 years) completed a treadmill-desk walking and a seated control condition, separated by 48 hours. During each condition, participants completed computerized versions of the Stroop test, a modified flanker task, and a test of reading comprehension. RESULTS: No significant differences in response speed or accuracy were found between walking and sitting conditions for any the cognitive tests. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that performance on cognitive tasks, including executive control processes, are not impaired by walking on an active workstation. Implementing active workstations into offices and classrooms may help to decrease sedentariness without impairing task performance.

Reports of sexual assault have been found to elicit online discourse incivility. The present study employs a computerized coding tool to examine linguistic characteristics of news media that are likely to influence discourse incivility-specifically, negative emotion, disagreement, and discussion about power relations. Additionally, machine learning was harnessed to measure the levels of comment toxicity, insult, profanity, threat, and identity attack in Reddit and Twitter posts sharing news reports of sexual assault. Findings reveal that linguistic features of news articles interact with platform community norms to predict rape culture as expressed within online responses to reports of sexual assault.

Hypertension in pregnancy	2015	train	3	6	0	Effect of socio-economic status and estimation of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant in preeclamptic pregnant women: a case-control study.  OBJECTIVE: Increased extent of lipid peroxidation and decreased antioxidant defense has been postulated as a major contributor to the development of preeclampsia. The present study was conducted to determine the serum level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and vitamin C in these patients. METHODS: This research was conducted as a case-control study to assess the extent of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in 150 preeclampsia patients and 174 healthy pregnant women. Lipid peroxidation was assessed by measuring serum MDA level, and antioxidant defense was evaluated for serum vitamin C by UV spectrophotometric method. Independent sample t test and Pearson's correlation test were used for the statistical analysis with statistical software package SPSS, version 16.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). RESULTS: Our study found significantly higher level of MDA (p < 0.05) and significantly lower level of vitamin C (p < 0.05) in preeclampsia patients in comparison to the control subjects. Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that there was negative correlation between the serum level of MDA and vitamin C for both patient (r = -0.057, p = 0.669) and control groups (r = -0.128, p = 0.487). Analysis of socio-economic data revealed that preeclampsia was more prevalent among the rural pregnant than the urban pregnant women (OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.665-3.14, p = 0.352). It was also observed that primigravida pregnant were at higher risk for the development of preeclampsia than the multigravida pregnant women (OR 1.87, 95% CI 0.868-4.04, p = 0.108). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum MDA and depleted serum vitamin C may be associated with the development of preeclampsia.

A representative sample (n = 10641) of Australian adults completed a structured diagnostic interview assessing the prevalence of mental and substance use disorders in the last year. The prevalence of DSM-IV (1.5%) and ICD-10 (1.7%) cannabis dependence was similar. DSM-IV and ICD-10 dependence criteria comprised unidimensional syndromes. The most common symptoms among dependent and non-dependent users were difficulties with controlling use and withdrawal, although there were marked differences in symptom prevalence. Dependent users reported a median of four symptoms. There was good to excellent diagnostic concordance (kappas = 0.7-0.9) between systems for dependence but not for abuse/harmful use (Y = 0.4). These findings provide some support for the validity of cannabis dependence.

The knowledge, skill level, and clinical practice habits of 97 dental hygienists were assessed after the hygienists completed a 24-hour continuing education course in local anesthesia. Three survey methods were used to assess changes: a written pretest/posttest, self-reports, and employer-reported behavior change. The self-report was completed prior to the course and again one month and six months after completion of the course. The dentists/employers completed the survey after six months. Data were analyzed by paired t-tests. There was a significant improvement in knowledge between the pretest and posttest, an increase in the number of dental hygienists administering local anesthesia, and an increased frequency of its use in the practice setting at both one and six months after the course. The majority of the dentists/employers stated that completion of the course by the dental hygienists had a positive impact on their practices as demonstrated by the practice running more smoothly, improved quality of dental hygiene services, more satisfied patients, and increased productivity of the dental hygienists.

Sleep	2019	train	12	9	3	The antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid attenuates intermittent hypoxia-related renal injury in a mouse model of sleep apnea.  STUDY OBJECTIVES: Oxidative stress and inflammation are proposed to mediate kidney diseases that occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We examined the hypothesis that alpha-lipoic acid (LA) prevents renal injury in a mouse model of sleep apnea. METHODS: Twenty male mice received either intermittent hypoxia (IH) or intermittent air (IA) with or without a LA-enriched diet for 60 days. Plasma and urine samples were collected at the end of study, and kidneys were harvested for protein analysis. RESULTS: Animals in the IH + LA group had lower levels (p < 0.05) of plasma oxidative stress (8-isoprostane) and inflammation (TNF-alpha). Renal oxidative stress was also reduced in mice in the IH + LA (p < 0.05) compared with IH-exposed mice that were fed regular diet. Renal cellular apoptosis and tubular injury were reduced in the IH + LA group. Treatment with LA attenuated IH-induced glomerular hypertrophy and increased albuminuria. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with LA prevents IH-induced renal injury in mice. LA may be a potential therapy for reducing renal dysfunction in patients with OSA. LA can also increase oxidative stress in healthy animals.

METHODS: gamma-MSH-deficient Pc2(-/-) mice, and resistant Mc3r(-/-) mice were studied acutely for measurement of blood pressure and glucose and insulin concentrations after > or =1 week of a high-sodium diet (HSD; 8% NaCl) compared to a normal-sodium diet (NSD; 0.4% NaCl). Mc3r(-/-) also underwent glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test. RESULTS: Both knockout strains were hypertensive and also exhibited fasting hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia on the HSD. Mc3r(-/-) mice on the HSD had impaired glucose tolerance and insulin-mediated glucose disposal compared to wild-type mice on either the HSD or the NSD, or to Mc3r(-/-) mice on the NSD. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate an interaction of interrupted gamma-MSH signaling with the HSD to cause hypertension on the one hand and abnormal glucose metabolism, with the characteristics of insulin resistance, on the other. Further study of the nature of this interaction should provide new insight into the mechanisms by which salt-sensitive hypertension and insulin resistance are linked.  
34417336	Strategic and contested use of food laws to ban smokeless tobacco products in India: a qualitative analysis of litigation.	Tobacco control	2023	train	8	0	0	Strategic and contested use of food laws to ban smokeless tobacco products in India: a qualitative analysis of litigation.  OBJECTIVE: To understand how food laws are used, contested and interpreted to ban certain forms of chewing tobacco in India. METHODS: A qualitative study analysing all the tobacco-related litigation under the food laws in India. We used an inductive thematic analysis of the litigation contents. RESULTS: The tobacco industry systematically deployed litigation to (1) challenge the categorisation of smokeless tobacco products as food, and hence, questioned the use of food laws for regulating these products; (2) challenge the regulatory power of the state government in banning tobacco products via the food laws; and (3) challenge the applicability of the general food laws that enabled stricter regulations beyond what is prescribed under the tobacco-specific law. CONCLUSION: Despite facing several legal challenges from the tobacco industry, Indian states optimised food laws to enable stricter regulations on smokeless tobacco products than were feasible through use of a tobacco-specific law.  
25761571	Individual Differences in Cue-Induced Motivation and Striatal Systems in Rats Susceptible to Diet-Induced Obesity.	Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology	2015	train	20	8	4	Individual Differences in Cue-Induced Motivation and Striatal Systems in Rats Susceptible to Diet-Induced Obesity.  Pavlovian cues associated with junk-foods (caloric, highly sweet, and/or fatty foods), like the smell of brownies, can elicit craving to eat and increase the amount of food consumed. People who are more susceptible to these motivational effects of food cues may have a higher risk for becoming obese. Further, overconsumption of junk-foods leading to the development of obesity may itself heighten attraction to food cues. Here, we used a model of individual susceptibility to junk-foods diet-induced obesity to determine whether there are pre-existing and/or diet-induced increases in attraction to and motivation for sucrose-paired cues (ie, incentive salience or 'wanting'). We also assessed diet- vs obesity-associated alterations in mesolimbic function and receptor expression. We found that rats susceptible to diet-induced obesity displayed heightened conditioned approach prior to the development of obesity. In addition, after junk-food diet exposure, those rats that developed obesity also showed increased willingness to gain access to a sucrose cue. Heightened 'wanting' was not due to individual differences in the hedonic impact ('liking') of sucrose. Neurobiologically, Mu opioid receptor mRNA expression was lower in striatal 'hot-spots' that generate eating or hedonic impact only in those rats that became obese. In contrast, prolonged exposure to junk-food resulted in cross-sensitization to amphetamine-induced locomotion and downregulation of striatal D2R mRNA regardless of the development of obesity. Together these data shed light on individual differences in behavioral and neurobiological consequences of exposure to junk-food diets and the potential contribution of incentive sensitization in susceptible individuals to greater food cue-triggered motivation.  
34494003	Effects of COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine period on physical activity and dietary habits of college-aged students.	Sports medicine and health science	2021	train	35	9	0	Effects of COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine period on physical activity and dietary habits of college-aged students.  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to sudden extreme changes in lifestyle, potentially causing adverse changes in physical activity, sedentary behavior, and dietary habits. The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of COVID-19 quarantine on physical activity, dietary habits, and food insecurity among college students who were impacted by the quarantine periods and campus closures. The findings of the study will provide preliminary evidence on dietary, physical activity, and sedentary behavior changes induced by the pandemic among college students. Participants (n = 403) completed a cross-sectional self-report online questionnaire, evaluating the physical activity, sedentary behavior, and dietary behaviors before- and during-COVID-19 campus closures (March-May 2020). Sociodemographic and descriptive information was also obtained from each participant. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess changes in physical activity, sedentary behavior, and dietary habits. McNemar's test was used to compare food insecurity changes. Data were presented as median and interquartile range. A total of 291 participants who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study (college-aged, 18-24 years). Physical activity decreased at vigorous (2 days/week to 1 day/week, p < 0.001), moderate (4 days/week to 1 day/week, p < 0.001), and light (4 days/week to 2 days/week, p < 0.001) intensity levels, while sedentary behavior increased (4 h/day to 7 h/day, p < 0.001) from pre-to during-COVID-19 quarantine period. Frequencies of meals at home and alcohol consumption increased (Z = -3.911 and Z = -4.022, p < 0.001), while frequency of fruit consumption decreased (Z = -2.116, p < 0.001) from pre-to during-COVID-19 quarantine period. Daily alcohol intake also increased during COVID-19 quarantine period (Z = -4.442, p < 0.001). Lastly, the percentage of individuals reporting food insecurity significantly increased during COVID-19 quarantine (p < 0.001). College-aged students in quarantine significantly decreased physical activity participation and increased sedentary behavior. Changes in dietary habits were observed, including increased meals at home, alcohol consumption, and decreased fruit consumption. Food insecurity also doubled among college-aged students during quarantine. Public health strategies to attenuate these changes in lifestyle habits should be implemented during a global pandemic.  
28903922	Risk of relapse after antidepressant discontinuation in anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis of relapse prevention trials.	BMJ (Clinical research ed.)	2017	train	1	7	0	Risk of relapse after antidepressant discontinuation in anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis of relapse prevention trials.  Objectives To examine the risk of relapse and time to relapse after discontinuation of antidepressants in patients with anxiety disorder who responded to antidepressants, and to explore whether relapse risk is related to type of anxiety disorder, type of antidepressant, mode of discontinuation, duration of treatment and follow-up, comorbidity, and allowance of psychotherapy.Design Systematic review and meta-analyses of relapse prevention trials.Data sources PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and clinical trial registers (from inception to July 2016).Study selection Eligible studies included patients with anxiety disorder who responded to antidepressants, randomised patients double blind to either continuing antidepressants or switching to placebo, and compared relapse rates or time to relapse.Data extraction Two independent raters selected studies and extracted data. Random effect models were used to estimate odds ratios for relapse, hazard ratios for time to relapse, and relapse prevalence per group. The effect of various categorical and continuous variables was explored with subgroup analyses and meta-regression analyses respectively. Bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool.Results The meta-analysis included 28 studies (n=5233) examining relapse with a maximum follow-up of one year. Across studies, risk of bias was considered low. Discontinuation increased the odds of relapse compared with continuing antidepressants (summary odds ratio 3.11, 95% confidence interval 2.48 to 3.89). Subgroup analyses and meta-regression analyses showed no statistical significance. Time to relapse (n=3002) was shorter when antidepressants were discontinued (summary hazard ratio 3.63, 2.58 to 5.10; n=11 studies). Summary relapse prevalences were 36.4% (30.8% to 42.1%; n=28 studies) for the placebo group and 16.4% (12.6% to 20.1%; n=28 studies) for the antidepressant group, but prevalence varied considerably across studies, most likely owing to differences in the length of follow-up. Dropout was higher in the placebo group (summary odds ratio 1.31, 1.06 to 1.63; n=27 studies).Conclusions Up to one year of follow-up, discontinuation of antidepressant treatment results in higher relapse rates among responders compared with treatment continuation. The lack of evidence after a one year period should not be interpreted as explicit advice to discontinue antidepressants after one year. Given the chronicity of anxiety disorders, treatment should be directed by long term considerations, including relapse prevalence, side effects, and patients' preferences.  
14740505	Risk of transmission of leptospirosis from infected cattle to dairy workers in southern Israel.	The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ	2004	train	3	7	0	Risk of transmission of leptospirosis from infected cattle to dairy workers in southern Israel.  BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that occurs worldwide, found predominantly in agricultural workers, port workers and dairy workers. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk of disease transmission to dairy workers following an outbreak in 1999 of Leptospirosis hardjo in the dairy herds of two kibbutzim in southern Israel. METHODS: A seroepidemiologic survey of all the dairy workers from these two kibbutzim was conducted, including individual interview and examination. Data were collected on the presence of clinical symptoms of leptospirosis during the previous month. One month later the medical personnel on the two kibbutzim were contacted in order to determine if any worker had subsequently developed clinical signs or symptoms of leptospirosis. All dairy workers had blood drawn for serology. Those workers whose initial serology had been borderline for leptospirosis had a repeated serology test between 2 and 4 weeks later. Doxycycline was given prophylactically to all dairy workers on one kibbutz only. RESULTS: Either with or without chemoprophylaxis, no dairy workers exposed to herds infected with Leptospira hardjo showed evidence of seroconversion or disease. This indicated a low risk of transmission of this serovar from cows to dairy workers. CONCLUSION: Since human illness with leptospirae can cause illness associated with significant morbidity, we recommend that physicians make an informed decision regarding doxycycline prophylaxsis for dairy workers exposed to cattle herds infected with Leptospira hardjo.  
31387571	Prevalence and associated factors of childhood overweight/obesity among primary school children in urban Nepal.	BMC public health	2019	train	21	6	2	Prevalence and associated factors of childhood overweight/obesity among primary school children in urban Nepal.  BACKGROUND: Childhood overweight/obesity has become a major public health concern globally because of its adverse health consequences and escalating prevalence. The factors underlying the disease conditions manifested during adulthood commonly originate in childhood. Nepal is going through a transition where under-nutrition co-exists with obesity; however, there is a lack of well-documented information on childhood overweight or obesity in Nepal. This study was carried out to determine the prevalence and associated factors of childhood overweight/obesity among urban primary school children. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May to October of 2017. Behavioral data were collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire with parents of children aged 6-13 years old in grades 1-5 studying in private schools of Lalitpur district in Nepal. Study participants were selected using two-stage cluster random sampling from 10 private schools. Height and weight measurements of 575 children were taken and BMI-for-age-sex was calculated using WHO AnthroPlus. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21. Associated factors were examined using Chi-square tests followed by multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The study found that out of 575 students, 107 (18.6%) were overweight and 41 (7.1%) were obese. Among 328 male children, 62 (19.0%) were overweight and 35 (10.6%) were obese. Likewise, among 247 female children, 45 (18.2%) were overweight and 6 (2.4%) were obese. Male children (aOR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.38-3.53), children of mothers with a high school (aOR = 3.13, 95% CI: 1.39-7.12) or university level of education (aOR = 3.09, 95% CI: 1.23-7.70) and children of mothers in a professional field (aOR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.02-4.05) had a greater likelihood of being overweight/obese. Likewise, students consuming energy-dense less nutrient food (aOR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.66-5.12), lacking active travel to and from school (aOR = 2.38, 95% CI: 1.12-4.79) and those having sedentary behaviors (aOR = 3.01, 95% CI: 1.20-7.29) were likely to be overweight/obese. CONCLUSIONS: More than one-quarter of the children in urban Lalitpur were found to be overweight/obese. High junk food consumption and sedentary activity were found to be significantly associated with childhood overweight/obesity. School health and awareness programs aiming to reduce the intake of energy-dense foods and promote an active lifestyle including active transportation to school among children are imperative. Future studies to objectively measure the type and amount of food intake and physical activity of students are recommended.  
9684707	Risk factors for male breast cancer (United States).	Cancer causes & control : CCC	1998	train	17	11	6	Risk factors for male breast cancer (United States).  OBJECTIVES: The etiology of male breast cancer is obscure, although an excess risk has been associated with Klinefelter syndrome, testicular disorders, benign breast disease including gynecomastia, use of exogenous estrogens, radiation, and a family history of male or female breast cancer. We conducted a case-control study to investigate risk factors further for breast cancer in men. METHODS: Based on data from the 1986 National (United States) Mortality Followback Survey (NMFS) of almost 20,000 deceased adults (age 25 years or over), we compared information obtained from next-of-kin interviews of 178 men who died of breast cancer with that of 512 male controls who died of other causes. Information was obtained on selected demographic and other factors, including diet, exercise, occupation, height and weight, and use of tobacco and alcohol. RESULTS: Increased risks were found for men who were described by their next-of-kin as very overweight (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-5.0). The risks associated with the three upper quartiles of body mass index (BMI) (wt/ht2) were 1.3, 1.6, and 2.3, respectively, with a significant dose-response relationship (P < 0.01). An excess risk was also associated with limited exercise (OR = 1.3, CI = 0.8-2.0). Consumption of red meat was associated with an increased risk, and consumption of fruits and vegetables with a decreased risk, although the trends were not significant. No association was found for tobacco or alcohol use, but an excess risk was associated with higher levels of socioeconomic status (SES) (OR = 1.8, CI = 1.1-3.0). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that obesity increases the risk of male breast cancer, possibly through hormonal mechanisms, while dietary factors, physical activity, and SES indicators also deserve further investigation.

Central giant cell granuloma (CGCG) is an uncommon benign intraosseous lesion of the jaw, found predominantly in children and young adults below 30 years of age. The purpose of this article was to present a summary of the current literature and a case report of an 11-year-old boy diagnosed with an aggressive CGCG involving the anterior maxilla that was removed in 2004 and subsequently recurred almost 3 years later in 2006. The presenting features of the patient and the effect of combined surgical and orthodontic treatment for this condition are discussed. This case shows how the dentition was successfully maintained with conservative surgery and orthodontic treatment in spite of the extensive destruction of the supporting bone, and the importance of long-term follow-up. The report also reminds orthodontic practitioners that rare pathological conditions can occur in their child patient groups.

International journal of geriatric psychiatry	2007	train	18	13	6	Work-related physical activity and the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  BACKGROUND: Leisure-time physical activity has been related with a reduced risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The effects of occupational and commuting physical activity (physical activity at work and on the way to work) on cognitive health are still unclear. This study aimed to clarify the association between work-related physical activity and dementia/AD. METHODS: Participants of the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia (CAIDE) study were derived from random, population-based samples previously studied in a survey carried out in 1972, 1977, 1982, or 1987. After an average follow-up of 21 years, 1449 individuals (73%) aged 65 to 79 years participated in the re-examination in 1998. RESULTS: Neither occupational [Odds Ratio (OR) 1.45; 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 0.66-3.17] nor commuting physical activity (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.10-2.17) were associated with the risk of dementia or AD after adjustments for age, sex, education, follow-up time, locomotor symptoms, main occupation during life, income at midlife, leisure-time physical activity, other subtype of work-related physical activity, ApoE genotype, vascular disorders and the smoking status. There were also no interactions between work-related physical activity and the ApoE epsilon4 genotype, leisure-time physical activity or sex. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, work-related physical activity was not found to be sufficient to protect against dementia and AD later in life. The lack of effect might be partly due to a residual confounding. Nevertheless, physical activity during leisure-time may be beneficial even for people who are physically active at work or when commuting.

Journal of aging and physical activity	2020	train	8	0	0	The Effect of Pre-Post Differences in Walking, Health, and Weight on Retirees' Long-Term Quality of Life.  This research examined the effect of pre-post differences in walking duration, health, and weight on retirees' long-term quality of life (QoL). It used data from a 2018 randomized mail survey of 483 suburban New Jersey retirees. Ordinary least squares and three-stage least squares models were used. The analysis showed that changes in walking duration during the first 2 years of retirement are directly associated with health change, health change has an effect on long-term QoL, and weight variation of 10 lb or more has an effect on health change and long-term QoL. Although QoL peaks for the sample of retirees at around age 75, people whose average walking duration increased, health improved, and weight did not increase substantially after retirement continued to experience high QoL for a longer time. The results show that people can achieve high long-term QoL by choosing an active lifestyle when transitioning to retirement.

Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco	2000	train	23	0	0	Home smoking restrictions and adolescent smoking.  The prevention of adolescent smoking has focused on peer influences to the relative neglect of parental influences. Parents socialize their children about many behaviors including smoking, and parental rules about their child's smoking have been related to lower levels of adolescent smoking. Moreover, among adults, indoor smoking restrictions have been associated with decreased smoking. Accordingly, the current study tested the relation of adolescent smoking to home smoking policy (rules regulating where adults are allowed to smoke in the home). Results showed that restrictive home smoking policies were associated with lower likelihood of trying smoking for both middle and high school students. However, for high school students this relation was restricted to homes with non-smoking parents. Home smoking policies were not associated with current regular smoking for either middle or high school students. Home smoking policies may be useful in preventing adolescent smoking experimentation, although longitudinal and experimental research is necessary to confirm this hypothesis.

Diabetes research and clinical practice	2008	train	9	7	0	Leisure time physical activity in individuals with screen-detected type 2 diabetes compared to those with known type 2 diabetes.  AIMS: To investigate whether leisure time physical activity (LTPA) characteristics differ between individuals with previously undiagnosed (screen-detected) and those with previously diagnosed (known) type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A population-based random sample of 1364 (participation rate 61%) men and 1461 (65%) women aged 45-74 years participated in a cross-sectional health examination including an oral glucose tolerance test and physical activity assessment by a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Women with screen-detected type 2 diabetes (n=110) were physically less active than those with known type 2 diabetes (n=68) with differences in the duration of physical activity sessions (multivariate-adjusted P=0.041) and the number of moderate to high intensity exercise sessions per week (multivariate-adjusted P=0.007). In men no differences in LTPA were observed between individuals with screen-detected (n=126) and with known type 2 diabetes (n=109). CONCLUSIONS: This study supplies indirect evidence that in women, but not in men, with diagnosed type 2 diabetes exercise counselling or other treatment related factors produces the desired increase in LTPA.  
3097814	[Food allergies. III. Therapy: elimination diet, symptomatic drug prophylaxis and specific hyposensitization].	Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift	1986	train	14	21	3	[Food allergies. III. Therapy: elimination diet, symptomatic drug prophylaxis and specific hyposensitization].  The treatment of food allergies is logically based on strict elimination of causative allergens. While it is easy to eliminate food which is infrequently consumed, it is more difficult to manage an allergy involving regularly consumed foods, especially where patients have to eat away from home for professional reasons. The creation of elimination diets for milk, eggs, and mould and yeast allergies is discussed. In raw food and vegetable allergy the act of cooking is often sufficient to denature the allergen as it is unstable to heat. Follow-up investigations show that some 50% of children achieve cure spontaneously by strict elimination diet, especially in regard to milk allergy. In our own 173 (mainly adult) patients with food allergy, some 2/3 reported after 3-5 years that a strict elimination diet had to be followed, since otherwise prompt relapse of allergic symptoms was noted. About 1/3 of patients, mainly with milk, cheese or egg allergy, can hope for spontaneous desensitization by appropriate diet. This is demonstrated by a case history with disappearance of IgE antibodies. Should this fail to occur, oral desensitization with milk or egg-white extracts offers an effective therapy. The practice of hyposensitization with foodstuffs is illustrated by examples and tabulation of immunologic parameters. In raw food or vegetable allergy, which is often associated with birch or mugwort pollinosis, improvement or even complete cure can be expected in about 1/3 of cases by systematic desensitization of pollinosis. On the other hand, the therapy and prognosis of food allergy involving extreme and polyvalent sensitivities, especially to spices, or with multifactorially induced symptoms, is more problematic. In these cases a strict elimination diet should be followed by continuous prophylactic/symptomatic treatment with antianaphylactic substances such as cromoglicinic acid (Nalcrom) - especially in gastrointestinal food allergies - or with ketotifen (Zaditen) or oxatomide (Tinset) in hematogenically released shock fragments. Patients with severe anaphylactic reactions after meals should, by analogy with patients with hymenoptera allergy, carry an emergency kit containing an adrenaline spray (Medihaler-Epi), a soluble corticosteroid (e.g. Betnesol) and anthistaminic drugs (e.g. Tavegyl, Teldane).

Previous studies have shown that a brain wave pattern known as stimulus preceding negativity (SPN) can index the anticipation of motivationally relevant events. The present study was the first to use SPN as an index of the motivational significance of smoking-related pictures. Emotionally positive and neutral pictures served as controls. The paradigm involved the following sequence: (a) presentation of a picture (S1) for 500 ms, (b) a fixation cross for 3,500 ms, (c) a second presentation (S2) of the same picture for 2,000 ms, and (d) another fixation cross signifying the beginning of a new S1-S2 trial using a different picture. The participants (N = 24, half smokers and half nonsmokers) viewed pictures from three categories (smoking-related, emotionally positive, or emotionally neutral). Consistent with predictions, smokers exhibited significantly greater mean SPN amplitudes in anticipation of smoking-related pictures relative to neutral pictures. Among nonsmokers the SPN was significantly smaller in anticipation of smoking pictures compared with neutral pictures. These findings are consistent with the incentive sensitization theory of addiction and other conditioning and cue-reactivity models.

Acta tropica	2021	train	11	7	6	Immunosuppression by UVB radiation exacerbates Leishmania mexicana skin lesions in mice.  Cutaneous leishmaniasis is the most common form of leishmaniasis in humans. The disease is caused by several species, such as Leishmania mexicana, a protozoa parasite. Several major risk factors are associated with this disease, including poverty, poor housing, inadequate domestic hygiene, malnutrition, mobility, and occupational exposure. Solar radiation (UVB) has not been considered a risk factor because there is no scientific evidence demonstrating a correlation with increased susceptibility to cutaneous leishmaniasis. In this study, the shaved skin of the back of C57BL/6 mice was irradiated with 24.2 mJ/cm(2) of UVB. A delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction was used to assess UV-induced immune suppression. Skin lesions were quantitated, and parasite burden and the presence of anti-Leishmania mexicana antibodies in serum and germinal centers in draining lymph nodes were determined. We found an increased in the lesion size and parasitic load in UVB-irradiated mice compared to the WT mice and B lymphocyte activation in draining lymph nodes and increased IgG1 production. Our results show an important role of UVB-induced suppression in cutaneous leishmaniasis through local production of IL-10 and systemic IgG1antibodies. This is the first study that demonstrates the effects of UVB radiation on cutaneous leishmaniasis by Leishmania mexicana.

Psychotherapy research : journal of the Society for Psychotherapy Research	2020	train	3	2	0	Destabilization in self-ratings of the psychotherapeutic process is associated with better treatment outcome in patients with mood disorders.  Objective: While destabilization periods characterized by high variability and turbulence in a patient's psychological state might seem obstructive for psychotherapy, a complex systems approach to psychopathology predicts that these periods are actually beneficial as they indicate possibilities for reorganization within the patient. The present study tested the hypothesis that destabilization is related to better treatment outcome.Method: 328 patients who received psychotherapy for mood disorders completed daily self-ratings about their psychotherapeutic process. A continuous measure of destabilization was defined as the relative strength of the highest peak in dynamic complexity, a measure for variability and turbulence, in the self-ratings of individual patients.Results: Destabilization was found to be related to better treatment outcome. When improvers and non-improvers were analyzed separately, destabilization was found to be related to better treatment outcome in improvers but not in non-improvers.Conclusions: Destabilization in daily self-ratings of the psychotherapeutic process is associated with better treatment outcome. The identification of destabilization periods in process-monitoring data is clinically relevant. During destabilization, patients are believed to be increasingly sensitive to the effects of therapy. Clinicians could tailor their interventions to these sensitive periods.  
2824385	Lung cancer among Chinese women.	International journal of cancer	1987	train	12	13	9	Lung cancer among Chinese women.  A case-control study involving interviews with 672 female lung cancer patients and 735 population-based controls was conducted to investigate the high rates of lung cancer, notably adenocarcinoma, among women in Shanghai. Cigarette smoking was a strong risk factor, but accounted for only about one-fourth of all newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer. Most patients, particularly with adenocarcinoma, were life-long non-smokers. The risks of lung cancer were higher among women reporting tuberculosis and other pre-existing lung diseases. Hormonal factors were suggested by an increased risk associated with late menopause and by a gradient in the risk of adenocarcinoma with decreasing menstrual cycle length, with a 3-fold excess among women who had shorter cycles. Perhaps most intriguing were associations found between lung cancer and measures of exposure to cooking oil vapors. Risks increased with the numbers of meals cooked by either stir frying, deep frying or boiling; with the frequency of smokiness during cooking; and with the frequency of eye irritation during cooking. Use of rapeseed oil, whose volatiles following high-temperature cooking may be mutagenic, was also reported more often by the cancer patients. The findings thus confirm that factors other than smoking are responsible for the high risk of lung cancer among Chinese women and provide clues for further research, including the assessment of cooking practices.

Little information exists about the prevalence of dental caries among Egyptian adults. Therefore, this study investigated the dental caries experience among Egyptian adults in correlation with different risk factors. Methods : A total of 359 Egyptian adults (age range, 18-74 years) were examined over a period of 3 months, starting on the 15 (th) of November 2017 until the 13 (th) of January 2018. Socio-demographic data, brushing frequency, body mass index (BMI) and eating habits were recorded and collected using a questionnaire. Dental examination was performed using the Decayed, Missing and Filled tooth (DMFT) index. Results : In total, 86.63% of participants had dental caries experience. Of the participants, 60.45%, 48.47% and 55.43% had at least one decayed, missing and filled tooth, respectively. The mean number of decayed, missing, filled or DMFT for the whole sample were 2.4+/-3.6, 1.98+/-3.99, 1.79+/-2.45, 6.09+/-5.7, respectively. Decayed teeth were inversely correlated with socio-economic status (SES), education level, brushing frequency and milk consumption and positively correlated with grains, junk food and soda drinks consumption. Missing teeth were inversely correlated with SES, education level and brushing frequency, while positively correlated with age, BMI and caffeinated drink consumption. Conversely, filled teeth were positively correlated with age, BMI, SES and education level, while negatively correlated with grains and sugars in drinks. Conclusion : The present study clarifies that age, BMI, SES, education level and brushing frequency are risk factors significantly associated with dental caries prevalence amongst Egyptian adults. Egyptian adults' dietary habits might lead to obesity, which indirectly causes dental caries rather than directly as in children.

Sleep medicine	2019	train	18	10	3	Diabetes management mediates the association between sleep duration and glycemic control in youth with type 1 diabetes mellitus.  OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of diabetes management and sleep duration with glycemic control in youth with type 1 diabetes mellitus. PATIENTS/METHODS: 111 participants (mean age = 13.59 +/- 2.11 years, 52.3% male, 50.5% non-white) wore actigraphy (average duration = 5.5 nights) and completed self-reported daily sleep diaries (average duration = 5.3 nights). Parents and participants each completed the Diabetes Management Scale (DMS) as part of a neurobehavioral evaluation. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and daily frequency of self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) were collected from patient medical records. RESULTS: Youth with T1DM slept below the recommended amount of sleep for this age group (M = 7.45, SD = 0.74), which is approximately 9 h for school aged youth. They were in poor glycemic control with an average HbA1c of 9.11% (SD = 1.95) and their SMBG frequency was 4.9 (SD = 2.71). Average sleep duration from actigraphy was significantly correlated with average SMBG frequency and inversely related to HbA1c, indicating that less sleep was associated with worse management and glycemic control. When entered into a mediation model, diabetes management (SMBG frequency) completely mediated the relationship between sleep duration and glycemic control (HbA1c). Different sleep parameters of sleep quality, time to sleep, and sleep consistency also significantly correlated with HbA1c, SMBG, and parent and child-reports of various aspects of diabetes management. In particular, later bedtimes and a greater social jetlag predicted worse glycemic control. CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of sleep deprived and poorly controlled youth with T1DM, diabetes management was an intermediary factor between sleep duration and glycemic control. Additional analyses of data supported circadian influences on glycemic control. These results highlight the importance of addressing sleep duration, quality, and consistency as part of routine diabetes management in this population.  
16463960	Cancer incidence among male military and civil pilots and flight attendants: an analysis on published data.	Toxicology and industrial health	2005	train	13	11	6	Cancer incidence among male military and civil pilots and flight attendants: an analysis on published data.  Flight personnel are exposed to cosmic ionizing radiation, chemicals (fuel, jet engine exhausts, cabin air pollutants), electromagnetic fields from cockpit instruments, and disrupted sleep patterns. Only recently has cancer risk among these workers been investigated. With the aim of increasing the precision of risk estimates of cancer incidence, follow-up studies reporting a standardized incidence ratio for cancer among male flight attendants, civil and military pilots were obtained from online databases and analysed. A meta-analysis was performed by applying a random effect model, obtaining a meta-standardized incidence ratio (SIR), and 95% confidence interval (CI). In male cabin attendants, and civil and military pilots, meta-SIRs were 3.42 (CI = 1.94-6.06), 2.18 (1.69-2.80), 1.43 (1.09-1.87) for melanoma; and 7.46 (3.52-15.89), 1.88 (1.23-2.88), 1.80 (1.25-2.58) for other skin cancer, respectively. These tumors share as risk factors, ionizing radiation, recreational sun exposure and socioeconomic status. The meta-SIRs are not adjusted for confounding; the magnitude of risk for melanoma decreased when we corrected for socioeconomic status. In civil pilots, meta-SIR was 1.47 (1.06-2.05) for prostate cancer. Age (civil pilots are older than military pilots and cabin attendants) and disrupted sleep pattern (entailing hyposecretion of melatonin, which has been reported to suppress proliferative effects of androgen on prostate cancer cells) might be involved. In male cabin attendants, meta-SIR was 21.5 (2.25-205.8) for Kaposi's sarcoma and 2.49 (1.03-6.03) for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. AIDS, which was the most frequent single cause of death in this occupational category, likely explains the excess of the latter two tumors.

OBJECTIVE: ""We-ness,"" a couple's mutual investment in their relationship and in each other, has been found to be a potent dimension of couple resilience. This study examined the development of a method to capture We-ness in psychotherapy through the coding of relationship narratives co-constructed by couples (""We-Stories""). It used a coding system to identify the core thematic elements that make up these narratives. METHOD: Couples that self-identified as ""happy"" (N = 53) generated We-Stories and completed measures of relationship satisfaction and mutuality. These stories were then coded using the We-Stories coding manual. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicated that security, an element that involves aspects of safety, support, and commitment, was most common, appearing in 58.5% of all narratives. This element was followed by the elements of pleasure (49.1%) and shared meaning/vision (37.7%). The number of ""We-ness"" elements was also correlated with and predictive of discrepancy scores on measures of relationship mutuality, indicating the validity of the We-Stories coding manual. Limitations and future directions are discussed.  "

Sleep medicine	2012	train	13	8	1	Leg movements during wakefulness in restless legs syndrome: time structure and relationships with periodic leg movements during sleep.  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Approximately one third of patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS) also show periodic leg movements (PLM) during relaxed wake fulness (PLMW). In contrast with the large amount of data published on periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS), PLMW have received less attention from the scientific community. The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlations/differences of time-structure and response to a dopamine-agonist between PLMW and PLMS in patients with RLS. METHODS: Ninety idiopathic RLS patients and 28 controls were recruited. Subjects underwent clinical and neurophysiological evaluation, hematological screening, and one or two consecutive full-night polysomnographic studies. A subset of patients received 0.25mg of pramipexole or placebo before the second recording. Polysomnographic recordings were scored and LM activity was analyzed during sleep and during the epochs of wakefulness occurring during the first recording hour. RESULTS: RLS patients had higher LM activity during wakefulness than controls, but with a similar periodicity. Even if correlated, the ability of the PLMW index to predict the PLMS index decreased with increasing LM activity. Intermovement intervals during wakefulness showed one peak only at approximately 4s, gradually decreasing with increasing interval in both patients and controls. The effect of pramipexole was very limited and involved the small periodic portion of LM activity during wakefulness. CONCLUSIONS: PLMW index and PLMS index were correlated; however, the magnitude of this correlation was not sufficient to suggest that PLMW can be good predictors of PLMS. Short-interval LM activity during wakefulness and sleep might be linked to the severity of sleep disruption in RLS patients and the differences between their features obtained during wakefulness or sleep might be relevant for the diagnosis of sleep disturbances in RLS.

In this paper, a numerical model is presented to study the indoor air quality (IAQ) in a room with different emission sources, sinks, and ventilation methods. A computer program, ACCESS-IAQ, is developed to simulate the airflow pattern, the time history of the contaminant concentrations in the occupied zone, and the inhalation exposures. The program developed may be useful for IAQ professional to design healthy and comfortable indoor environments. A numerical study has been carried out to predict the effectiveness of a displacement ventilation and a mixing ventilation on volatile organic compound (VOC) removal in a model office. Results from the numerical predictions show that when a ""wet"" emission source (a freshly painted wood stain) is distributed uniformly across the floor area with sinks (gypsum board) from the four vertical walls, displacement ventilation has consistently lower exposure at the breathing level of the occupant in the room. Such an effect is mainly due to the higher ventilation efficiency of displacement ventilation compared to the mixing ventilation. The simulation results also show that the walls adsorb significant amounts of VOCs during the first hour and act as secondary sources thereafter.  "

14688494	Meeting the challenge to improve the treatment of hypertension in blacks.	Journal of clinical hypertension (Greenwich, Conn.)	2003	train	14	7	0	Meeting the challenge to improve the treatment of hypertension in blacks.  Hypertension is more prevalent and severe in African descendent populations living outside Africa than in any other population. Given this greater burden of hypertension in blacks, it is increasingly necessary to refine strategies to prevent the disorder as well as improve its treatment and control. This review assesses results from clinical trials on lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions to identify which approaches most effectively prevent adverse hypertension-related outcomes in African descendent populations. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) study provided evidence that a carefully controlled diet rich in fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy foods, and reduced in saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol (i.e., the DASH diet) reduces blood pressure in blacks and is well accepted. The combination of the DASH diet with reduction in dietary sodium below 100 mmol/d may provide a reduction in blood pressure beyond that reached by the DASH diet alone. Physical exercise and interventions to reduce psychological stress may also reduce blood pressure in blacks. Strong evidence from numerous studies is a compelling argument for continuing to recommend diuretics and beta blockers as first-line antihypertensive therapy for persons of all races. Some new studies also favor angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as first-line antihypertensive drugs. The African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension provided evidence that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-based treatment program is more beneficial than calcium channel blockers and beta blockers in reducing the progression of renal failure in blacks with hypertensive nephropathy. Studies in patients with diabetes have also shown evidence that both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists are more effective than other classes of antihypertensives in reducing adverse renal events. Studies to evaluate the effects of the new antihypertensives in improving outcomes in blacks living outside the United States are needed.

Journal of gambling studies	2008	train	13	0	0	Real limits in the virtual world: self-limiting behavior of Internet gamblers.  The recent expansion of Internet gambling has stimulated debate, policy, and research on this relatively new phenomenon and its potential consequences. The current study focuses on bettors experiencing problems by sampling Internet gamblers who imposed limits on the amount they were allowed to deposit to a betting site. We analyzed the betting transactions over 18 months of all gamblers who subscribed to an online betting site in February, 2005 (N = 47,134), 567 of whom utilized the site's self-limit feature. Self-limiting gamblers played a wider variety of games and placed more bets than others prior to imposing limits. After imposing limits, self-limiters reduced their activity, but did not reduce the amount they wagered per bet. Time spent gambling, not just money spent, appears to be an important indicator of gambling problems. Self-limit programs appear to be promising options for Internet gamblers at-risk for gambling problems.

Environment international	2014	train	1	0	0	Integrated testing strategy (ITS) for bioaccumulation assessment under REACH.  REACH (registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals) regulation requires that all the chemicals produced or imported in Europe above 1 tonne/year are registered. To register a chemical, physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological information needs to be reported in a dossier. REACH promotes the use of alternative methods to replace, refine and reduce the use of animal (eco)toxicity testing. Within the EU OSIRIS project, integrated testing strategies (ITSs) have been developed for the rational use of non-animal testing approaches in chemical hazard assessment. Here we present an ITS for evaluating the bioaccumulation potential of organic chemicals. The scheme includes the use of all available data (also the non-optimal ones), waiving schemes, analysis of physicochemical properties related to the end point and alternative methods (both in silico and in vitro). In vivo methods are used only as last resort. Using the ITS, in vivo testing could be waived for about 67% of the examined compounds, but bioaccumulation potential could be estimated on the basis of non-animal methods. The presented ITS is freely available through a web tool.

A wider array of treatments are needed for people with substance abuse disorders. Some psychedelic compounds have been assessed as potential substance abuse treatments with promising results. MDMA may also help treat substance abuse based on shared features with psychedelic compounds and recent reports indicating that MDMAassisted psychotherapy can reduce symptoms of PTSD. Narrative reports and data from early investigations found that some people reduced or eliminated their substance use after receiving MDMA, especially in a therapeutic setting. MDMA is a potent monoamine releaser with sympathomimetic effects that may indirectly activate 5-HT2A receptors. It increases interpersonal closeness and prosocial feelings, potentially through oxytocin release. Findings suggest that ecstasy, material represented as containing MDMA, is associated with deleterious long-term effects after heavy lifetime use, including fewer serotonin transporter sites and impaired verbal memory. Animal and human studies demonstrate moderate abuse liability for MDMA, and this effect may be of most concern to those treating substance abuse disorders. However, subjects who received MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in two recent clinical studies were not motivated to seek out ecstasy, and tested negative in random drug tests during follow-up in one study. MDMA could either directly treat neuropharmacological abnormalities associated with addiction, or it could indirectly assist with the therapeutic process or reduce symptoms of comorbid psychiatric conditions, providing a greater opportunity to address problematic substance use. Studies directly testing MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in people with active substance abuse disorder may be warranted.

Cooking oil fumes have been suggested to increase the risk of lung cancer in Chinese women by exposing them to mutagenic substances. We investigated the association between lung cancer and locally made rapeseed and linseed oils in a population-based case-control study in Gansu Province, China. Two hundred and thirty-three incident, female lung cancer cases diagnosed from 1994-98 were identified. A control group of 459 women was selected from census lists and were frequency matched on age and prefecture. Interviewers obtained information on cooking practices and cooking oil use. The odds ratio (OR) for lung cancer associated with ever-use of rapeseed oil, alone or in combination with linseed oil, was 1.67 (95% CI 1.0-2.5), compared to use of linseed oil alone. ORs for stir-frying with either linseed or rapeseed oil 15-29, 30 and > or =31 times per month were 1.96,1.73, and 2.24, respectively (trend, P=0.03), relative to a lower frequency of stir-frying. Lung cancer risks also increased with total number of years cooking (trend, P<0.09). Women exposed to cooking fumes from rapeseed oil appeared to be at increased risk of lung cancer, and there was some evidence that fumes from linseed oil may have also contributed to the risk.

Maternal & child nutrition	2020	train	15	15	3	Using structural equation modelling to understand the contributors to anaemia among young Burkinabe children.  Anaemia is a persistent problem among young Burkinabe children, yet population-specific information on its determinants is scant. We used baseline data from an evaluation of Helen Keller International's Enhanced Homestead Food Production Program (n=1210 children) to quantify household-, mother-, and child-level factors associated with anaemia in Burkinabe children aged 6-12 months. We used structural equation modelling to assess a theoretical model, which tested four categories of factors: (a) household food security and dietary diversity, (b) household sanitation and hygiene (latrine and poultry access and bednet ownership), (c) maternal factors (anaemia, stress, cleanliness, and health, hygiene and feeding knowledge and practices), and (d) child nutrition and health (iron deficiency (ID), retinol binding protein (RBP), malaria, and inflammation). The model also included household socio-economic status, size, and polygamy; maternal age and education; and child age and sex. Results showed that ID, malaria, and inflammation were the primary direct determinants of anaemia, contributing 15%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. Maternal knowledge directly explained improved child feeding practices and household bednet ownership. Household dietary diversity directly explained 18% of child feeding practices. Additionally, RBP, child age and sex, and maternal anaemia directly predicted child haemoglobin. Our findings suggest that program effectiveness could be increased by addressing the multiple, context-specific contributors of child anaemia. For young Burkinabe children, anaemia control programs that include interventions to reduce ID, malaria, and inflammation should be tested. Other potential intervention entry points suggested by our model include improving maternal knowledge of optimal health, hygiene, and nutrition practices and household dietary diversity.

Sleep medicine reviews	2002	train	3	15	2	Clinical symptomatology and treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder.  Patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS) suffer from sensory and motor symptoms evoked in the limbs at rest. Symptoms increase in the evening and during the night. The circadian rhythm and the presence of involuntary periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS) which are frequently associated with arousals probably cause the leading symptom of sleep disturbances in RLS. Patients who do not have typical RLS symptoms but whose polysomnography shows PLMS that either impact on sleep continuity or daytime functioning are diagnosed as having the periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). Dopaminergic agents such as levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (DDI) and dopamine agonists are considered the treatment of choice for RLS and PLMS. This article gives an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical symptomatology and diagnosis of RLS and PLMD and focuses on treatment strategies in both disorders.  
21717148	Suspicion of viral gastroenteritis does improve compliance with hand hygiene.	Infection	2011	train	6	10	2	Suspicion of viral gastroenteritis does improve compliance with hand hygiene.  PURPOSE: Viral gastroenteritis is common on pediatric wards, increasing the need for adherence with hand hygiene recommendations in order to prevent cross-transmission. Therefore, we investigated hand hygiene reflecting complete work-day activities on pediatric wards and focused on the influence of viral gastroenteritis. There are, so far, no studies representing complete working days on pediatric wards or addressing the influence of viral gastroenteritis. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study (144 h in each group) on hand hygiene behavior in the care for children with and without suspected or proven viral gastroenteritis. RESULTS: We documented 40 and 30 hand hygiene opportunities per patient-day for ward-associated healthcare workers for children with and without viral gastroenteritis, respectively (P = 0.316). Healthcare workers' compliance with hand hygiene recommendations was significantly higher in children with viral gastroenteritis compared to those without, i.e., 72 versus 67% (P = 0.033), especially among physicians, being 92 versus 50% (P = 0.032). Compliance tended to be higher after patient contact than before, especially in the children with gastroenteritis (78 vs. 62%; P = 0.083). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that viral gastroenteritis seemed to increase the number of daily opportunities for hand hygiene and did significantly increase compliance. In particular, this effect was seen after patient contact. Further research might address the awareness of undiagnosed transmissible diseases in order to prevent cross-transmissions.

Child protection workers in 33 states and the District of Columbia participated in a survey conducted by the C. Henry Kempe National Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Child Abuse and Neglect to determine the attitudes and attributes of workers who terminate their careers in child protection. A year after the survey, telephone follow-up was done to identify respondents to the survey who had left the child protection field. Attributes and attitudes were then linked directly to whether workers had terminated or continued child protective service. Just 8.0% (15 of 187) of the workers had left the field. There were few differences between workers that departed and those whose services were retained. Both were generally dissatisfied with their profession at the time of the survey. The shrinking social service labor market and worker investment in the field are discussed as factors impeding turnover among child protection workers.  
15309450	Carotenoids and their metabolites are naturally occurring activators of gene expression via the pregnane X receptor.	European journal of nutrition	2004	train	16	0	0	Carotenoids and their metabolites are naturally occurring activators of gene expression via the pregnane X receptor.  Carotenoids are important micronutrients in the human diet and are present in human serum at micromolar concentrations. In addition to their antioxidant potential, carotenoids obtain physiologically relevant properties such as influencing cellular signal pathways, gene expression or induction of detoxifying enzymes. In this study, we determined the transactivation of PXR by cotransfection with the full-length receptor and a PXR-responsive reporter gene. Carotenoids and retinol revealed a 5-6 fold reporter gene activity in HepG2 cells in comparison to a 7-fold induction by the well-known PXR agonist rifampicin, whereas apo-carotenals and lycopene exerted less or no activation potential. The inductive efficacy was hereby concentration-dependent. In addition, carotenoid- or retinol-mediated gene expression of PXR-responsive genes like CYP3A4/CYP3A7, CYP3A5, MDR-1 and MRP-2 has been determined in HepG2 cells by RT-PCR with up-regulative properties of beta-carotene or retinol being comparable to or even higher than that of rifampicin. In conclusion, PXR-mediated up-regulation of CYP3A4/CYP3A7 and CYP3A5 as well as MDR1 and MRP2 by carotenoids points to a potential interference on the metabolism of xenobiotic and endogenous relevant compounds.

Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (1995)	1998	train	2	0	0	Managing the uncertainties of low-level radioactive waste disposal.  The disposal of low-level radioactive waste (LLRW) entails financial and safety risks not common to most market commodities. This manifests debilitating uncertainty regarding future waste volume and disposal technology performance in the market for waste disposal services. Dealing with the publicly perceived risks of LLRW disposal increases the total cost of the technology by an order of magnitude, relative to traditional shallow land burial. Therefore, this analysis first examines five proposed disposal facility designs and quantifies the costs associated with these two important sources of uncertainty. Based upon this analysis, a marketable disposal permit mechanism is proposed and analyzed for the purpose of reducing market uncertainty and thereby facilitating a market solution to the waste disposal problem. In addition to quantifying the costs, the results illustrate the ways in which the design of a technology is influenced by its institutional environment, and vice versa.

The etiology of vulvar and vaginal squamous cell carcinoma (VV-SCC) has received little attention. A total of 182 women with invasive VV-SCC (116 with VV-SCC(vulva), 66 with VV-SCC(vagina)), 164 uterine corpus cancer controls and 518 population controls were interviewed in a population-based case-control study in Denmark, and 87 (48%) of the VV-SCC cases had tissue samples examined for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA using the GP5+/6+ PCR-EIA assay and subsequent reverse line blotting for HPV typing. Logistic regression-derived odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals served as relative risks. Cervical cancer-associated high-risk HPVs (hrHPVs) were detectable in most (89%) examined cases of VV-SCC(vagina) and in half (50%) of cases of VV-SCC(vulva) (p < 0.001). In site-specific multivariate logistic regression analyses, statistically significant risk factors for both VV-SCC(vulva) and VV-SCC(vagina) included measures of hrHPV exposure (anogenital warts for VV-SCC(vulva); cervical neoplasia and poor genital hygiene for VV-SCC(vagina)), tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. Furthermore, socioeconomic variables (marital status and years at school) were associated with risk of VV-SCC(vulva). Comparing hrHPV-positive and hrHPV-negative VV-SCCs in polytomous logistic regression analysis revealed that tobacco smoking and cervical neoplasia were significant risk factors only for hrHPV-positive VV-SCCs. Our study shows that VV-SCC(vulva) and VV-SCC(vagina) share measures of prior hrHPV exposure, tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption as statistically significant risk factors. HPV vaccination programs aimed at reducing the burden of cervical cancers are likely to also provide considerable protection against VV-SCCs.

Clinical and translational allergy	2020	train	17	19	36	Respiratory diseases and allergy in farmers working with livestock: a EAACI position paper.  Farmers constitute a large professional group worldwide. In developed countries farms tend to become larger, with a concentration of farm operations. Animal farming has been associated with negative respiratory effects such as work-related asthma and rhinitis. However, being born and raised or working on a farm reduces the risk of atopic asthma and rhinitis later in life. A risk of chronic bronchitis and bronchial obstruction/COPD has been reported in confinement buildings and livestock farmers. This position paper reviews the literature linking exposure information to intensive animal farming and the risk of work-related respiratory diseases and focuses on prevention. Animal farming is associated with exposure to organic dust containing allergens and microbial matter including alive microorganisms and viruses, endotoxins and other factors like irritant gases such as ammonia and disinfectants. These exposures have been identified as specific agents/risk factors of asthma, rhinitis, chronic bronchitis, COPD and reduced FEV1. Published studies on dust and endotoxin exposure in livestock farmers do not show a downward trend in exposure over the last 30 years, suggesting that the workforce in these industries is still overexposed and at risk of developing respiratory disease. In cases of occupational asthma and rhinitis, avoidance of further exposure to causal agents is recommended, but it may not be obtainable in agriculture, mainly due to socio-economic considerations. Hence, there is an urgent need for focus on farming exposure in order to protect farmers and others at work in these and related industries from developing respiratory diseases and allergy.

Archives of medical science : AMS	2012	train	13	8	7	Prevalence of obesity in children aged 6-12 years in Greece: nutritional behaviour and physical activity.  INTRODUCTION: During the last two decades, obesity has proved to be one of the most important problems of public health, and it is considerably more frequent in developed countries, not only in adults, but in children, too. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two thousand three hundred and seventy-four pupils in primary education were considered for the study (1206 boys and 1168 girls). RESULTS: In the population-based study, the proportion of overweight children was 23.9%, of obese children 7.3%, and of those with central obesity 35.5%. The boys were obese in a higher percentage than the girls (9.2% vs. 5.3%, p < 0.05). The obesity rates were gradually reduced as the children were growing older. The nutritional habits which were identified to have a positive association with obesity were the following: skipping breakfast, not consuming fruits and vegetables, and consuming bread and soft drinks. Children's healthy nutrition in school was related to lower rates of generalised and central obesity, while the hours spent watching TV were positively associated with all types of obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Results from the study suggest that a high proportion of children are overweight or obese. Therefore, it is important to adhere to a healthy lifestyle which emphasizes healthy food choices and habits, regular physical activity, and limiting screen time.

Normotensive subjects had significantly higher IGF1 levels (0.11+/-0.94 SDS) than those with mild (-0.62+/-1.16 SDS, P<0.0001) or severe (-1.01+/-1.07 SDS, P<0.0001) hypertension. IGF1 SDS (t=-3.41, P=0.001) independently predicted systolic and diastolic BP (t=-2.77, P=0.006) values. NGT subjects had significantly higher IGF1 levels (0.13+/-0.90 SDS) than those with IGT (-0.86+/-1.14 SDS, P<0.0001) or diabetes mellitus (-1.31+/-1.13 SDS, P<0.0001). IGF1 SDS independently predicted fasting glucose (t=-3.49, P=0.0005) and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-R (t=-2.15, P=0.033) but not insulin (t=-1.92, P=0.055) and HOMA-beta (t=-0.19, P=0.85). CONCLUSION: IGF1 levels in the low normal range are associated with hypertension and diabetes in subjects without pituitary and cardiovascular diseases.

The American journal of clinical nutrition	2009	train	8	9	3	Prevalence of daily hyperglycemia in obese type 2 diabetic men compared with that in lean and obese normoglycemic men: effect of consumption of a sucrose-containing beverage.  BACKGROUND: Hyperglycemia forms a direct and independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular comorbidities in type 2 diabetes. Consumption of sucrose-sweetened soft drinks might further increase the prevalence of hyperglycemic episodes. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess glycemic control in type 2 diabetic subjects and healthy lean and obese control subjects under strict dietary standardization but otherwise free-living conditions, with and without the consumption of soft drinks. DESIGN: Obese type 2 diabetic men (n = 11) and lean (n = 10) and obese (n = 10) normoglycemic male control subjects participated in a randomized crossover study. The subjects were provided with a standardized diet in 2 periods, during which they consumed 250 mL water with or without (control) sucrose (37.5 g) 2 h after breakfast and lunch. Blood glucose concentrations were assessed by continuous glucose monitoring. RESULTS: In the type 2 diabetic subjects, the mean 24-h glucose concentrations were significantly elevated (9.1 +/- 0.6 mmol/L), and hyperglycemia (glucose >10 mmol/L) was evident over 33 +/- 8% (8 +/- 2 h) of a 24-h period (P < 0.01). Hyperglycemia was rarely present in the normoglycemic lean and obese control subjects (5 +/- 2%/24 h for both). Consumption of 75 g sucrose, equivalent to 2 cans of a soft drink, did not further augment the prevalence of hyperglycemia throughout the day in any group. CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetic subjects taking oral blood glucose-lowering medication experience hyperglycemia during most of the daytime. Moderate consumption of sucrose-sweetened beverages does not further increase the prevalence of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetic subjects or in normoglycemic lean or obese men.  
29627509	Neuroimaging findings as predictors of treatment outcome of psychotherapy in anxiety disorders.	Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry	2019	train	7	10	5	Neuroimaging findings as predictors of treatment outcome of psychotherapy in anxiety disorders.  Anxiety disorders are the largest group of mental disorders and a leading cause of impairment, implicating in high costs for health systems and society. Effective pharmacological and psychological treatments are available, but a significant fraction of these patients does not respond adequately to these treatments. The objective of this study is to identify neuroimaging findings that could predict response to psychotherapy in anxiety disorders. METHODS: The authors reviewed psychotherapy clinical trials with neuroimaging conducted with patients with anxiety disorders. A systematic review was performed in MEDLINE database through PubMed, the Cochrane Collaboration's Clinical Trials Register (CENTRAL), PsycINFO and Thomson Reuters's Web of Science. RESULTS: From the studies included in this review, 24 investigated anxiety disorder patients, and findings in the amygdala, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula predicted response to psychotherapy in social anxiety disorder. Findings in ACC, hippocampus, insula, dlPFC, amygdala and inferior frontal gyrus (iFG) predicted response to psychotherapy in panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. LIMITATIONS: There was great heterogeneity between the included studies regarding neuroimaging techniques and the tasks performed during functional neuroimaging. CONCLUSION: Neuroimaging studies suggest that abnormalities in hippocampus, amygdala, iFG, uncus and areas linked with emotional regulation (dlPFC and ACC), predict a good outcome to psychotherapy in anxiety disorders.

Journal of physical activity & health	2011	train	22	11	5	Occupational physical activity and the metabolic syndrome among working women: a Go Red North Dakota study.  OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) with occupational physical activity (OCPA) and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) among working women. METHODS: The prevalence of MetSyn was calculated for 642 working women. Self-report questionnaire was used to determine levels of OCPA and LTPA and other lifestyle factors. Biometric data were directly collected on all women. RESULTS: No direct relationship for OCPA and the MetSyn was determined. Sufficient LTPA however, was significantly associated with lower prevalence of MetSyn. No dose response relationship was determined with PA and MetSyn. The odds of having MetSyn was significantly higher for sedentary workers with insufficient LTPA compared with those achieving sufficient LTPA. The odds for MetSyn were similar among women employed in moderately active or heavy work yet completing insufficient LTPA compared with women doing sufficient LTPA. CONCLUSIONS: For women with sedentary occupations, a sufficient amount of LTPA is essential to reduce the risk of having the MetSyn. Women in moderate to heavy working occupations may be acquiring adequate amounts of PA to avoid having the MetSyn.

Journal of nursing scholarship : an official publication of Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing	2017	train	14	20	6	Correlates of Nocturia and Relationships of Nocturia With Sleep Quality and Glycemic Control in Women With Type 2 Diabetes.  PURPOSES: To explore correlates of nocturia, compare sleep quality and glycemic control for women with and without nocturia, and examine relationships of nocturia with sleep quality and glycemic control in women with diabetes. DESIGN: This study was a cross-sectional, correlational study with data collected from 275 women with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify correlates. Chi-squared tests were used to identify candidate variables for the first logistic regression model. A one-way analysis of variance was used to compare sleep quality and glycemic control for women with and those without nocturia. Pearson correlations were used to examine the relationships of nocturia with sleep quality and glycemic control. FINDINGS: Of the 275 participants, 124 (45.1%) had experienced nocturia (at least two voids per night). Waist circumference, parity, time since diagnosis of diabetes, sleep quality, and increased daytime urinary frequency were correlated with nocturia after adjusting for age. Compared to women without nocturia, women who had nocturia reported poorer sleep quality. A significant correlation was found between the number of nocturnal episodes and sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: Nocturia and poor sleep are common among women with diabetes. The multifactorial nature of nocturia supports the delivered management and treatments being targeted to underlying etiologies in order to optimize women's symptom management. Interventions aimed at modifiable correlates may include maintaining a normal body weight and regular physical exercise for maintaining a normal waist circumference, and decreasing caffeine consumption, implementing feasible modifications in sleeping environments and maintaining sleep hygiene to improve sleep quality. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Healthcare professionals should screen for nocturia and poor sleep and offer appropriate nonpharmacological lifestyle management, behavioral interventions, or pharmacotherapy for women with diabetes.  
18204969	Polymorphisms in folate metabolizing enzymes and transport proteins and the risk of breast cancer.	Breast cancer research and treatment	2008	train	3	7	3	Polymorphisms in folate metabolizing enzymes and transport proteins and the risk of breast cancer.  BACKGROUND: An accumulating body of evidence suggests that there is an inverse relationship between the intake of folate (a water-soluble B-vitamin) and the risk of developing breast cancer. Individual variation in the genes involved in the transport of folate, or its metabolism, may affect risk, or may modify the association between folate and breast cancer risk. METHODS: We performed a case-control study to evaluate the association between common polymorphisms in six folate-related genes and the risk of breast cancer in 1,009 breast cancer patients and 907 healthy controls. Study subjects were genotyped for eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these six genes. RESULTS: We observed no association between the MTHFR, RFC, MS and MTRR genotypes and the risk of breast cancer. CONCLUSION: These data do not support the hypothesis that genetic variation in genes involved in the metabolism of folate are implicated in the etiology of breast cancer.

Psychotherapy research : journal of the Society for Psychotherapy Research	2014	train	2	0	0	The experience of group mindfulness-based interventions for individuals with mental health difficulties: a meta-synthesis.  OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to synthesize the findings of qualitative studies examining the experience of individuals with mental health difficulties attending mindfulness-based interventions. METHOD: A meta-synthesis of 15 qualitative studies was carried out, using a thematic synthesis approach. RESULTS: The meta-synthesis identified eight analytical themes: 'prior experiences and expectations', 'normalising and supportive process of the group', 'relating differently to thoughts and feelings', 'acceptance', 'a sense of control and choice', 'relationship with self and others', 'struggles', and 'awareness'. CONCLUSIONS: A conceptual framework is presented which accounts for the participants' experiences and suggests a process through which they renegotiate their relationship with their mental health difficulties.

Child abuse & neglect	2017	train	13	0	0	Classification of maltreatment-related mortality by Child Death Review teams: How reliable are they?  Accurate estimation of the incidence of maltreatment-related child mortality depends on reliable child fatality review. We examined the inter-rater reliability of maltreatment designation for two Alaskan Child Death Review (CDR) panels. Two different multidisciplinary CDR panels each reviewed a series of 101 infant and child deaths (ages 0-4 years) in Alaska. Both panels independently reviewed identical medical, autopsy, law enforcement, child welfare, and administrative records for each death utilizing the same maltreatment criteria. Percent agreement for maltreatment was 64.7% with a weighted Kappa of 0.61 (95% CI 0.51, 0.70). Across maltreatment subtypes, agreement was highest for abuse (69.3%) and lowest for negligence (60.4%). Discordance was higher if the mother was unmarried or a smoker, if residence was rural, or if there was a family history of child protective services report(s). Incidence estimates did not depend on which panel's data were used. There is substantial room for improvement in the reliability of CDR panel assessment of maltreatment related mortality. Standardized decision guidance for CDR panels may improve the reliability of their data.  
22275135	Does inadequate sleep play a role in vulnerability to obesity?	American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council	2012	train	10	16	8	Does inadequate sleep play a role in vulnerability to obesity?  The prevalence of obesity is increasing rapidly worldwide, which is cause for concern because obesity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, reduces life expectancy, and impairs quality of life. A better understanding of the risk factors for obesity is therefore a critical global health concern, and human biologists can play an important role in identifying these risk factors in various populations. The objective of this review is to present the evidence that inadequate sleep may be a novel risk factor associated with increased vulnerability to obesity and associated cardiometabolic disease. Experimental studies have found that short-term sleep restriction is associated with impaired glucose metabolism, dysregulation of appetite, and increased blood pressure. Observational studies have observed cross-sectional associations between short sleep duration (generally <6 h per night) and increased body mass index or obesity, prevalent diabetes, and prevalent hypertension. Some studies also reported an association between self-reported long sleep duration (generally >8 h per night) and cardiometabolic disease. A few prospective studies have found a significant increased risk of weight gain, incident diabetes, and incident hypertension associated with inadequate sleep. Given the potential link between inadequate sleep and obesity, a critical next step is to identify the social, cultural, and environmental determinants of sleep, which would help to identify vulnerable populations. Future human biology research should consider variation in sleep characteristics among different populations and determine whether the associations between sleep and obesity observed in Western populations persist elsewhere.

International journal of group psychotherapy	2004	train	7	7	2	I'm not the only one! group therapy with older children and adolescents who have learning disabilities.  Children and adolescents with learning disabilities (LD) are vulnerable to psychosocial difficulties. Both the detrimental impact of LD on social adjustment and the significance of peer relations for developmental needs make group therapy a natural intervention. Despite modifications that are required due to their cognitive deficits, many students with LD fit the criteria and can benefit from group psychotherapy. In this paper, a model of group therapy for older children and adolescents with LD is presented. The approach is informed by a combination of self psychology, mutual aid, and interpersonal group therapy. The leaders use special techniques to accommodate the LD and to foster the group process. Examples are presented to illustrate the approach.

European journal of nutrition	2021	train	18	9	18	Association between dietary intake and risk of ovarian cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  PURPOSE: It is unclear how dietary intake influences the ovarian cancer. The present paper sets out to systematically review and meta-analyze research on dietary intake to identify cases having high- or low-risk ovarian cancer. METHODS: Scopus, PubMed, and Wiley Online Libraries were searched up to the date November 24, 2019. Two reviewers were requested to independently extract study characteristics and to assess the bias and applicability risks with reference to the study inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses were performed to specify the relationship between dietary intake and the risk of ovarian cancer identifying 97 cohort studies. RESULTS: No significant association was found between dietary intake and risk of ovarian cancer. The results of subgroup analyses indicated that green leafy vegetables (RR = 0.91, 95%, 0.85-0.98), allium vegetables (RR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.64-0.96), fiber (RR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.98), flavonoids (RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.78-0.89) and green tea (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.49-0.76) intake could significantly reduce ovarian cancer risk. Total fat (RR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18), saturated fat (RR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.22), saturated fatty acid (RR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.04-1.36), cholesterol (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.22) and retinol (RR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.00-1.30) intake could significantly increase ovarian cancer risk. In addition, acrylamide, nitrate, water disinfectants and polychlorinated biphenyls were significantly associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. CONCLUSION: These results could support recommendations to green leafy vegetables, allium vegetables, fiber, flavonoids and green tea intake for ovarian cancer prevention.  
18479844	Attentional bias in addictive behaviors: a review of its development, causes, and consequences.	Drug and alcohol dependence	2008	train	6	0	0	Attentional bias in addictive behaviors: a review of its development, causes, and consequences.  A wealth of research from the past two decades shows that addictive behaviors are characterized by attentional biases for substance-related stimuli. We review the relevant evidence and present an integration of existing theoretical models to explain the development, causes, and consequences of addiction-related attentional biases. We suggest that through classical conditioning, substance-related stimuli elicit the expectancy of substance availability, and this expectancy causes both attentional bias for substance-related stimuli and subjective craving. Furthermore, attentional bias and craving have a mutual excitatory relationship such that increases in one lead to increases in the other, a process that is likely to result in substance self-administration. Cognitive avoidance strategies, impulsivity, and impaired inhibitory control appear to influence the strength of attentional biases and subjective craving. However, some measures of attentional bias, particularly the addiction Stroop, might reflect multiple underlying processes, so results need to be interpreted cautiously. We make several predictions that require testing in future research, and we discuss implications for the treatment of addictive behaviors.

INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer survivors face dual challenges: long term sequelae of treatment, and risk of recurrent disease. Obesity and a sedentary lifestyle complicate both challenges. The WISER Survivor trial assessed the effects of exercise and/or weight-loss on lymphedema, biomarkers of breast cancer recurrence, and quality of life. We report on the innovative transdisciplinary design of this trial and report attrition rates. METHODS: This one year trial randomized breast cancer survivors who had a BMI of >=25kg/m(2), were sedentary and had breast-cancer-related-lymphedema to 1) exercise (weight training and aerobic exercise) 2) weight-loss 3) exercise and weight-loss 4) or control group. Innovative aspects included: adaptation of a community-based weight training program to a largely home-based program; use of a commercial meal replacement system as part of the lifestyle modification weight-loss program; inclusion of measures of cost-effectiveness to enable economic evaluations; and alignment with a parallel mouse model for breast cancer recurrence to enable transdisciplinary research. In this model, mice bearing dormant residual tumor cells, which spontaneously relapse, were placed on a high-fat diet. Overweight animals were randomly assigned to exercise, calorie restriction, both, or control group and followed for cancer recurrence. The animal model will guide mechanistic biomarkers to be tested in the human trial. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: 351 participants were randomized; 13 experienced breast cancer recurrence during the trial. Of the 338 participants without recurrence, 83% completed the trial. The WISER Survivor trial will show the effects of exercise and weight-loss on lymphedema outcomes, biomarkers of recurrence and quality of life. NCT ClinicalTrials.gov registration #: NCT01515124.  
29989216	Research on electroencephalogram to measure thermal pleasure in thermal alliesthesia in temperature step-change environment.	Indoor air	2018	train	0	0	0	Research on electroencephalogram to measure thermal pleasure in thermal alliesthesia in temperature step-change environment.  Thermal pleasure is currently measured along psychological and physiological variables. However, in transient environments where temperatures change, it is hard to correlate psychological and physiological measures, because there is a delay in physiological changes. This study tests a method for correlating both measures using electroencephalogram (EEG), which can capture physiological feedback with a rapid response rate. In this experimental study, thermal pleasure was induced in a temperature step-change environment, one of non-uniform and transient environments. During the experiment, EEG was monitored and psychological responses of thermal sensation and thermal comfort votes were collected via survey questionnaire. A total of 50 males in their twenties participated in a climate chamber experiment. An experimental group of 25 men were exposed to temperature step-change between two different room conditions (32degreesC, 65% and 25degreesC, 50%), experiencing thermal pleasure. The control group of the remaining 25 men were exposed to an unchanging condition, experiencing thermal comfort close to thermal neutrality. The EEG spectral analysis demonstrated that EEG frequency band associated with pleasant emotional (theta) increased while frequency band related to pleasantness, satisfaction or relaxation (beta) decreased with thermal pleasure.  
22362059	Sleep duration and endometrial cancer risk.	Cancer causes & control : CCC	2012	train	17	8	1	Sleep duration and endometrial cancer risk.  PURPOSE: Recent data indicate that night shift work is associated with increased endometrial cancer risk, perhaps through a pathway involving lower melatonin production. Melatonin is an antiestrogenic hormone, with production in a circadian pattern that is dependent on presence of dark at night. Sleep duration is positively associated with melatonin production and may be an indicator of melatonin levels in epidemiologic studies. METHODS: We evaluated associations between self-reported sleep duration and endometrial cancer risk using publicly available prospective data on 48,725 participants in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, among whom 452 adjudicated incident cases of endometrial cancer were diagnosed over approximately 7.5 years of follow-up. Sleep duration was self-reported at baseline. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for endometrial cancer risk with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: Most women reported sleeping <= 6 (33.3%) or 7 (38.5%) h each night; fewer reported sleeping 8 (23.4%) or >= 9 (4.8%) h each night. In adjusted analyses, there was an indication of reduced risk associated with longer sleep duration, though no statistically significant association was observed. Women who slept >= 9 h had a nonsignificant reduced risk of endometrial cancer compared with women who slept <= 6 h (HR = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.51-1.46). CONCLUSIONS: We found weak evidence of an association between sleep duration and endometrial cancer risk. Self-reported sleep duration may not adequately represent melatonin levels, thus further studies utilizing urinary melatonin levels are necessary to establish the mechanism by which night shift work increases endometrial cancer risk.  
30367325	What Is the Impact of Comorbidities on the Risk for Postoperative Body-Contouring Surgery Complications in Postbariatric Patients?	Obesity surgery	2019	train	6	7	0	What Is the Impact of Comorbidities on the Risk for Postoperative Body-Contouring Surgery Complications in Postbariatric Patients?  BACKGROUND: There is an increasing number of patients presenting after massive weight loss for plastic surgery, and many of these patients have residual diseases that may compromise outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the impact of comorbidities on the development of postoperative complications in postbariatric patients undergoing plastic surgery procedures at the Federal District North Wing Regional Hospital, Brasilia, Brazil. METHODS: Descriptive, analytical, and prospective study was performed on patients who underwent plastic surgery following RYGB from January 2011 to December 2016. Measures included BMI (body mass index) before RYGB and before plastic surgery, medical complications and comorbidities. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-nine patients (130 female, 9 male) with a mean age of 41 years underwent 233 separate operations. The average BMI at the time of plastic surgery was 27.44 kg/m(2). The average weight loss was 47.02 kg, and the mean pre-weight-loss BMI (max BMI) was 45.17 kg/m(2). The most important pre-plastic comorbidities were arterial hypertension (11.5%), degenerative arthropathy (5.4%), diabetes mellitus (5.0%), and metabolic syndrome (4.3%). Of the 139 patients operated upon, 76.97% underwent abdominoplasty followed by mammoplasty (42.46%). The overall rate of complications was 26.65%. Initially, on univariate regression analyses, comorbidities influenced the development of postoperative complications. However, after multiple logistic regression, the most important comorbidities failed to predict an increased risk of complications. CONCLUSION: In this group of patients, with these anthropometric and clinical profiles, the most important comorbidities (diabetes, arterial hypertension, and metabolic syndrome) failed to influence the incidence of postoperative complications in postbariatric patients after plastic surgery.

Journal of physical activity & health	2014	train	9	0	0	Associations between physical activity parenting practices and adolescent girls' self-perceptions and physical activity intentions.  BACKGROUND: The current study investigated cross-sectional associations between maternal and paternal logistic and modeling physical activity support and the self-efficacy, self-esteem, and physical activity intentions of 11- to 12-year-old girls. METHODS: 210 girls reported perceptions of maternal and paternal logistic and modeling support and their self-efficacy, self-esteem and intention to be physically active. Data were analyzed using multivariable regression models. RESULTS: Maternal logistic support was positively associated with participants' self-esteem, physical activity self-efficacy, and intention to be active. Maternal modeling was positively associated with self-efficacy. Paternal modeling was positively associated with self-esteem and self-efficacy but there was no evidence that paternal logistic support was associated with the psychosocial variables. CONCLUSIONS: Activity-related parenting practices were associated with psychosocial correlates of physical activity among adolescent girls. Logistic support from mothers, rather than modeling support or paternal support may be a particularly important target when designing interventions aimed at preventing the age-related decline in physical activity among girls.

BMJ open	2019	train	16	18	10	Coronary heart disease, hypertension and use of biomass fuel among women: comparative cross-sectional study.  OBJECTIVES: To explore the associations of hypertension and coronary heart disease (CHD) with use of biomass fuel for cooking. DESIGN: Comparative cross-sectional study. SETTING: Rural villages in Sindh, Pakistan. PARTICIPANTS: Women aged >=40 years who had used biomass fuel for cooking for at least the last year (n=436), and a comparison group (n=414) who had cooked only with non-biomass fuel during the last year were recruited through door-to-door visits. None of those who were invited to take part declined. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Hypertension was determined from blood pressure measurements and use of medication. CHD was assessed by three measures: history of angina (Rose angina questionnaire), previous history of 'heart attack', and definite or probable changes of CHD on ECG. Potentially confounding risk factors were ascertained by questionnaire and anthropometry. Associations of hypertension and CHD with use of biomass and other risk factors were assessed by logistic regression, and summarised by ORs with 95% CIs. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, there was no association of hypertension (OR: 1.0, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.4) angina (OR: 1.0, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.4), heart attack (OR: 1.2, 95% 0.7 to 2.2) or ECG changes of CHD (OR: 0.8, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.2) with current use of biomass for cooking. Nor were any associations apparent when analyses were restricted to long-term (>=10 years) users and non-users of biomass fuel. CONCLUSIONS: A linked air monitoring study indicated substantially higher airborne concentrations of fine particulate matter in kitchens where biomass was used for cooking. It is possible that associations with CHD and hypertension were missed because most of the comparison group had used biomass for cooking at some time in the past, and risk remains elevated for many years after last exposure.  
32222955	Self-reported eating disorders and sleep disturbances in young adults: a prospective cohort study.	Eating and weight disorders : EWD	2021	train	13	14	12	Self-reported eating disorders and sleep disturbances in young adults: a prospective cohort study.  PURPOSE: To evaluate the prospective association between eating disorders, disordered eating behaviors, and sleep disturbances in young adults. METHODS: We used prospective cohort data of young adults aged 18-26 from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 12,082). Self-reported exposures of interest (at 18-26 years) included (1) an eating disorder diagnosis proxy; disordered eating behaviors such as (2) restrictive eating behaviors including fasting/skipping meals, (3) compensatory behaviors including vomiting, laxatives/diuretics, or weight loss pills; and (4) loss of control/overeating. Self-reported sleep disturbances at 7-year follow-up included trouble falling or staying asleep. RESULTS: In negative binomial regression models, all four exposures predicted both sleep disturbance outcomes at 7-year follow-up, when adjusting for demographic covariates and baseline sleep disturbances. When additionally adjusting for baseline depressive symptoms, the associations between eating disorder diagnosis proxies and trouble falling (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.24; 95% CI 1.05-1.46) and staying (IRR 1.16; 95% CI 1.01-1.35) asleep remained statistically significant; however, the associations between eating behaviors and sleep disturbances were attenuated. CONCLUSIONS: Eating disorders in young adulthood predict sleep disturbances at 7-year follow-up. Young adults with eating disorders or who engage in disordered eating behaviors may be assessed for sleep disturbances. LEVEL III: Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies.  
15723702	Fructose, insulin resistance, and metabolic dyslipidemia.	Nutrition & metabolism	2005	train	19	11	8	"Fructose, insulin resistance, and metabolic dyslipidemia.  Obesity and type 2 diabetes are occurring at epidemic rates in the United States and many parts of the world. The ""obesity epidemic"" appears to have emerged largely from changes in our diet and reduced physical activity. An important but not well-appreciated dietary change has been the substantial increase in the amount of dietary fructose consumption from high intake of sucrose and high fructose corn syrup, a common sweetener used in the food industry. A high flux of fructose to the liver, the main organ capable of metabolizing this simple carbohydrate, perturbs glucose metabolism and glucose uptake pathways, and leads to a significantly enhanced rate of de novo lipogenesis and triglyceride (TG) synthesis, driven by the high flux of glycerol and acyl portions of TG molecules from fructose catabolism. These metabolic disturbances appear to underlie the induction of insulin resistance commonly observed with high fructose feeding in both humans and animal models. Fructose-induced insulin resistant states are commonly characterized by a profound metabolic dyslipidemia, which appears to result from hepatic and intestinal overproduction of atherogenic lipoprotein particles. Thus, emerging evidence from recent epidemiological and biochemical studies clearly suggests that the high dietary intake of fructose has rapidly become an important causative factor in the development of the metabolic syndrome. There is an urgent need for increased public awareness of the risks associated with high fructose consumption and greater efforts should be made to curb the supplementation of packaged foods with high fructose additives. The present review will discuss the trends in fructose consumption, the metabolic consequences of increased fructose intake, and the molecular mechanisms leading to fructose-induced lipogenesis, insulin resistance and metabolic dyslipidemia.

American journal of epidemiology	1999	train	9	6	2	Physical activity in elderly subjects with impaired glucose tolerance and newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus.  The authors carried out a study to investigate the association between different indicators of physical activity and the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and newly diagnosed diabetes (nDM) in a population-based cohort of elderly men and women in the Netherlands. A sample of participants of the Rotterdam Study (n = 1,016) aged 55-75 years who were not known to have diabetes mellitus underwent an oral glucose tolerance test. Physical activity was assessed by means of a self-administered questionnaire and expressed as time spent on activities per week. Associations with the prevalence of IGT and nDM were assessed by logistic regression analysis after adjustment for age, body mass index, waist-hip ratio, family history of diabetes, and smoking. A total of 745 subjects had normal glucose tolerance, 153 IGT, and 118 nDM. The total amount of time spent on physical activity decreased with increasing glucose intolerance. Adjusted for main confounders, vigorous activities such as bicycling (men: odds ratio (OR) = 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14-0.49; women: OR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.18-0.78) and sports (men: OR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.11-0.74) showed an inverse association with the presence of nDM. For IGT, the associations pointed in the same direction but did not reach statistical significance. These results indicate that physical inactivity and glucose intolerance are associated among older adults similar to the way they are associated among middle-aged adults.

Cureus	2021	train	30	7	0	Assessment of the Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Lifestyle of the Population in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Online Survey Study.  Background The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created an unprecedented problem in people's lives around the world. Lockdown measures altered the routine lifestyle aspects of people including diet, exercise, sleep, stress, smoking, job status, recreation, and application of modern technologies. Understanding the lifestyle profile of individuals could help in designing effective interventions to minimize the risk factors of COVID-19-related health problems. Objectives The aim of this research is to investigate the lifestyle changes among adults living in Saudi Arabia (SA) during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Methods A cross-sectional survey study was done to investigate the lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia from August to September 2020. A pre-designed questionnaire was used for data collection and distributed online through social media. The questionnaire included items about sleep patterns, dietary habits, physical activity, employment status, recreation activities, use of social media, and screen time before and during the pandemic. Results A total of 338 adults with a median age of 40 years participated in the study. During the pandemic, employment, smoking decreased significantly (53.3 vs. 55.6%, p<0.001 & 15.7% vs. 18.3%, p=0.049) with significant increases in daily intake of fruits or vegetables (47% to 60.2%, p<0.001), caffeinated beverages (seven or more times caffeine, 3% vs. 0.9%, p<0.001), and water (more than eight water cups daily, 18.4 vs. 11.9, p<0.001). Overweight group increased significantly from 28.5% to 32% (p=0.009). Sleeping more than nine hours increased significantly from 8.3% to 21.8% (p<0.001) with increasing sleeping aids from 11.6% to 15.7% (p<0.001). Both the screen and the social media times increased significantly for six or more hours daily (14.8% vs. 35.3% and 9.5% vs. 28.2% respectively, p=<0.001 for both). There were significant decreases in socialization (91.4% vs. 37.8%) and fast food (71.98% vs. 47.04%), and increases in physically inactivity (19% vs. 5.3%) and stress (90.8% vs. 85.2%) (p<0.001 for all). Most participants perceived stress during the pandemic (307, 90.8%). Conclusion There were remarkable behavioral changes in all aspects of the lifestyle of the participants living in SA during the COVID-19 pandemic with some positive effects on smoking and dietary habits. However, negative changes included unemployment, physical inactivity, sleep disturbances, social isolation, and excessive weight gain. There is a need to study the possible consequences of such changes on the future population health in SA.  
11705018	Health care providers' experiences with problem gamblers.	Journal of gambling studies	2001	train	10	0	0	Health care providers' experiences with problem gamblers.  The purpose of this study was to document health care providers' awareness of problem gambling and frequency of recognition and treatment. An exploratory survey was designed to collect data on awareness and knowledge of problem gambling. A structured questionnaire was completed anonymously by 180 health care providers (nurses, physicians, social workers, and other allied health professionals). Almost all respondents (96%) reported knowledge of problem gambling, and 30% reported asking clients about gambling problems when they presented with stress related symptoms. A third of the respondents reported identifying and treating clients for a gambling problem. The most frequently reported intervention was referral to counseling and other gambling resources. Respondents were generally interested in learning more about gambling problems, particularly those providers who have had a client discuss gambling related concerns. There were no significant differences in findings between provider groups.  
31219049	Not Just a Headache: Qualitative Study About Web-Based Self-Presentation and Social Media Use by People With Migraine.	Journal of medical Internet research	2019	train	14	14	1	Not Just a Headache: Qualitative Study About Web-Based Self-Presentation and Social Media Use by People With Migraine.  BACKGROUND: To help with a long-term but invisible medical condition such as migraine, many people seek information and support on social media. The effect of using social media for people with migraine is not fully understood and remains to be investigated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe how people with migraine use social media and how social media use affects their identity and sense of self. METHODS: A total of 20 participants who experienced migraine were recruited via migraine-specific charities. Semistructured interviews were conducted with questions based on a topic guide. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: People with migraine are using social media to obtain information to better understand their condition and treatment options. Social media offers instant access to continuous information and social support. This exchange of social support and information was viewed as mutually beneficial. Participants viewed social media as an outlet to vent frustrations and validate the migraine experience. Several participants pointed out that the invisible and episodic nature of migraine can lead to societal misunderstanding of the impact and or severity of their condition. Some participants masked their online migraine-related behavior using different sites or closed online groups to control who saw their migraine-related content. Participating in closed social media groups sometimes changed Web-based behavior in other areas of the platform. This illustrates the complex relationship between migraine, social media, and identity. CONCLUSIONS: How migraine is part of an individual's identity and how this is represented online can vary. Social media can provide people who experience migraine with instant and continuous access to support and information, from a group of empathic others with similar lived experiences. Social media is used to validate the illness experience, as well as provide reassurance and help reduce feelings of isolation.  
11917830	Transcendental meditation, hypertension and heart disease.	Australian family physician	2002	train	9	11	5	Transcendental meditation, hypertension and heart disease.  BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence that stress contributes to the pathogenesis and expression of coronary heart disease has led to the increasing use of stress reduction techniques in its prevention and treatment. The most widely used and tested technique is transcendental meditation. OBJECT: To describe transcendental meditation and review research on its use in the treatment and prevention of coronary heart disease. DISCUSSION: Transcendental meditation shows promise as a preventive and treatment method for coronary heart disease. Transcendental meditation is associated with decreased hypertension and atherosclerosis, improvements in patients with heart disease, decreased hospitalisation rates and improvements in other risk factors including decreased smoking and cholesterol. These findings cannot be generalised to all meditation and stress reduction techniques as each technique differs in its effects. Further research is needed to delineate the mechanisms involved and to verify preliminary findings concerning atherosclerosis and heart disease and the findings of short term hypertension studies.

International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society	2019	train	0	11	0	Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering for the prevention of cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke.  BACKGROUND: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol has been long associated with the risk for ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. For more than a decade, the main pharmacological option to prevent stroke and myocardial infarction through LDL-cholesterol lowering was the use of statins. During the recent years, two novel classes of drugs have proven their efficacy and safety to reduce LDL-cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular events in large, well-conducted randomized controlled trials: ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors. AIMS: The present review summarizes the evidence arising from the latest trials of lipid-lowering treatment for cardiovascular outcomes prevention and discusses their implications for secondary prevention strategies in patients with ischemic stroke. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: There is strong evidence which confirms the hypothesis that the lower the LDL-cholesterol, the less frequent the cardiovascular events are and underlines the importance of treating our ischemic stroke patients with intensive statin treatment aiming at low LDL-cholesterol levels. The very low levels of LDL cholesterol seem to be safe, even in the mid/long term but longer follow-up data are needed. Currently there are no tools to reliably predict cardiovascular outcomes in the specific population of ischemic stroke patients. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke physicians should aim for low LDL-cholesterol levels by intensive statin treatment in all ischemic stroke patients. For those patients who are at the highest risk for recurrent stroke or another cardiovascular event and have unacceptable LDL-cholesterol levels despite intensive statin treatment, PCSK9 inhibitors should be considered.  
11345740	Investigation of a ponding irrigation system to recycle agricultural wastewater.	Environment international	2000	train	5	0	0	Investigation of a ponding irrigation system to recycle agricultural wastewater.  This article presents the results of natural carrying capacity of ponding irrigation system in Taoyuan agricultural zone, Taiwan. Both the systematic water quality and the ponding effects were examined. The ponding irrigation system included a flow channel and storage ponds. The data showed that most water characteristics deteriorated gradually from upper- to down-stream in the flow channel and the flow channel was not attributed to any self-purification in agricultural returning water practically. On the other hand, the results of storage ponds indicated that they can provide a natural treatment (i.e., the outlet water quality of the ponds is more desirable than that of the inlet). Consequently, the ponding irrigation system offers the natural self-purification in ponds to reuse and recycle the returning agricultural wastewater and to extend the irrigation capacity and efficiency.

Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco	2008	train	12	0	0	Nicotine decreases attentional bias to negative-affect-related Stroop words among smokers.  The present study examined the hypothesis that nicotine is associated with reduced attentional bias to affective and smoking-related stimuli in a modified Stroop task. A total of 56 habitual smokers were each tested on 4 days with 14 mg nicotine patches and placebo patches, counterbalanced, as a within-subjects factor in a double-blind design. A modified Stroop using negative-affect words, smoking words, color words, and neutral words was presented via computer in blocked format. As predicted, nicotine, relative to placebo, was associated with decreased attentional bias to negative words. Nicotine speeded performance during smoking-word and color-word blocks to the same degree as during neutral words and thus appeared to also have a nonspecific performance-enhancing effect. In an exploratory analysis, nicotine-attention effects occurred only in the initial presentation of pairs of blocked word pages. Nicotine also was associated with improved mood. The results are discussed in terms of affect-attention and smoking literatures.  
14643283	Environmental exposure to cooking oil fumes and cervical intraepithelial neoplasm.	Environmental research	2004	train	18	6	6	Environmental exposure to cooking oil fumes and cervical intraepithelial neoplasm.  The fumes from cooking oil, similar to cigarette smoke, contain numerous carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aromatic amines, nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, etc. In this study, we examined the association between exposure to cooking oil fumes and the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasm. The study population in this nested case-control study consisted of women above the age of 19 years living in Chia-Yi County, located in the southwestern Taiwan, who had received pap smear screening between October, 1999, and December, 2000 (n=32,466). The potential cases were women having lesions greater than cervical intraepithelium neoplasm II (> or =CIN2) reconfirmed by cervical biopsy (n=116). The potential controls (case: control=1:2) were age-matched (+/-2 years) and residence-matched women who had normal pap smears within 6 months of the cases. In total, 100 cases and 197 controls were completely interviewed by public health nurses about cooking methods, ventilation, and other potential risk factors. Women who cooked at home in a kitchen (n=269) without the presence of a fume extractor at least once a week between the ages of 20 and 40 had a 2.29 times higher risk [95% confidence interval (CI)=1.08-4.87] of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasm than those who did not cook once a week in such a kitchen during the same age span, after adjusting for other potential confounders. This finding was further strengthened by the finding that women who did not use the fume extractors had a 2.47 times higher risk (95% CI=1.15-5.32) of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasm than women who cooked in kitchens with fume extractors that were always switched on while cooking. We also found a joint protective effect of fume extractor use among women older than 40 years (n=202) if they used the extractors during both age spans of their lives, ages 20-40 and >40 years. Comparing our findings on women more than 40 years old who used fume extractors during both periods, we found a 2.05-fold greater risk (95% CI=0.86-4.86) for those who used exhaust fans during only one of the two age spans and a 3.46-fold greater risk in those who had not used an exhaust fan for either period (95% CI=1.08-11.10) (trend test, P=0.02). While exposure to cooking oil fumes may cause cervical intraepithelial neoplasm, women can be protected from this risk by always cooking in kitchens equipped with fume extractors and by keeping them on while cooking.  
33708870	Association of apnea-hypopnea index during rapid eye movement sleep with insulin resistance in patients with suspected obstructive sleep apnea: a cross-sectional study.	Annals of translational medicine	2021	train	7	24	2	Association of apnea-hypopnea index during rapid eye movement sleep with insulin resistance in patients with suspected obstructive sleep apnea: a cross-sectional study.  Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with insulin resistance. However, the association between special stages of OSA [rapid eye movement (REM) sleep] and insulin resistance is not clear. This study was designed to assess the association of the frequency of respiratory events during REM sleep with insulin resistance in adults with suspected OSA. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 4,062 adult participants with suspected OSA who underwent polysomnography in our sleep center between 2009 and 2016 were screened. Polysomnographic variables, biochemical indicators, and physical measurements were collected. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for insulin resistance as assessed by the presence of hyperinsulinemia, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, the fasting insulin resistance index (FIRI), and Bennett's insulin sensitivity index (ISI). Results: The final analyses included 2,899 adults with suspected OSA. Multivariate adjustments, including the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) during non-REM sleep (AHINREM), were performed. The AHI during REM sleep (AHIREM) was found to be independently associated with insulin resistance across increasing AHIREM quartiles. For hyperinsulinemia the ORs (95% CIs) followed the order of 1.340 (1.022, 1.757), 1.210 (0.882, 1.660), and 1.632 (1.103, 2.416). For abnormal HOMA-IR, ORs (95% CIs) were 1.287 (0.998, 1.661), 1.263 (0.933, 1.711), and 1.556 (1.056, 2.293). For abnormal FIRI, ORs (95% CIs) were 1.386 (1.048, 1.835), 1.317 (0.954, 1.818), and 1.888 (1.269, 2.807). For abnormal Bennett's ISI, ORs (95% CIs) were 1.297 (1.003, 1.678), 1.287 (0.949, 1.747), and 1.663 (1.127, 2.452). All linear trends were statistically significant (P<0.01). Additionally, the results showed that REM sleep duration was independently associated with hyperinsulinemia (OR =0.777, 95% CI: 0.615-0.982; P<0.05). Conclusions: AHIREM was independently associated with hyperinsulinemia and an abnormal HOMA-IR, FIRI, and Bennett's ISI in adults with suspected OSA. Additionally, REM sleep duration was independently associated with hyperinsulinemia.

BMC public health	2016	train	0	18	0	Vitamin D deficiency is associated with high prevalence of diabetes in Kuwaiti adults: results from a national survey.  BACKGROUND: Vitamin D homeostasis may play a critical role in glucose metabolism. Little is known on vitamin D deficiency and its association with diabetes in countries of the Arabia Gulf where the population is experiencing a rapid increase in the incidence of diabetes. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of 960 adults enrolled in the first National Nutrition Survey of the State of Kuwait (NNSSK), we examined vitamin D status in association with the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes. Vitamin D status was measured by serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitami D (25(OH)D). Prevalences of diabetes and prediabetes were determined based on fasting glucose and HbA1C levels. RESULTS: The median level of serum 25(OH)D in Kuwaiti adults was 13.8 ng/ml. Approximately 56 % of the Kuwaiti adults had vitamin D inadequacy (25(OH)D = 12-19.9 ng/ml), and 27 % had vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D < 12 ng/ml). The prevalences of prediabetes and diabetes were 40 and 27 %, respectively. Vitamin D inadequacy (OR = 1.7, 95 % CI: 1.0-2.9) and deficiency (OR =2.0, 95 % CI: 1.1-3.3) was each associated with about two-fold increased odds of prediabetes compared to sufficient vitamin D status (25(OH)D >= 20 ng/ml). Vitamin D inadequacy (OR =2.1, 95 % CI: 1.2-3.7) and deficiency (OR =2.0, 95 % CI: 1.1-3.9) were also associated with two-fold increased odds of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Data from Kuwaiti's first nutrition nutritional survey suggests a very high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Kuwaiti adults. Associations of low vitamin D status and high prevalence of diabetes point to the need of continuous monitoring of vitamin D status and further evaluating potential health consequences in this high-risk population.

This study investigated the effects of feedstock additives [polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and NaCl] and spray dryer additives (SiO2, CaCl2, NaHCO3) on heavy metal and fly ash removal efficiencies, and on particle size distribution of heavy metals. A spray dryer with an integrated fabric filter was used as an air pollution control device (APCD). Removal efficiencies for fly ash and heavy metals were greater than 95 and 90%, respectively. When additives of PVC or NaCl were used, the concentration of heavy metals distributed in fly ash apparently varied when the particle diameter was <1 microm. Although the effects of the additives SiO2, CaCl2, and NaHCO3 on the elemental size distribution of Cr were insignificant, these additives did slightly increase concentrations of Cd, Zn, and Pb partitioning in coarser particles (>1 microm).

Results of the Attitudes to Psychotherapy Research Questionnaire with a sample of experienced German psychotherapists.  OBJECTIVE: Psychotherapy research needs to convince psychotherapists to contribute their time and effort to participate. The present paper describes the development and first results of the Attitudes to Psychotherapy Research Questionnaire (APRQ). METHOD: The APRQ and additional qualitative questions about exclusion criteria for participation were filled out by a sample of 365 therapists (psychoanalytic, psychodynamic, and cognitive-behavioral) during an Internet-based research survey. RESULTS: A principle component analysis yielded six factors: Benefits, Damage, Legitimation, Self-doubt, Effectiveness Doubt and External Reasons. Age, external reasons and benefits predicted willingness to participate independent of therapeutic school. DISCUSSION: Results show a changing trend to more positive attitudes to psychotherapy research. To be willing to participate in future research, therapists expected high quality designs, financial compensation, and personal gains.

Background: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the dementia literacy of community-dwelling adults in four cities (Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Macau, and Zhuhai) of the Greater Bay Area of China, and to determine their mass media preferences for receiving dementia information. Methods: The survey was completed by 787 community-dwelling adults. Dementia literacy was indirectly measured using two validated scales-the 30-item Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale and the 20-item Dementia Attitude Scale (DAS). Participants were also asked to indicate whether they wanted to receive dementia information via digital or traditional media. Chi-square tests, logistic regressions, and MANOVA analyses were conducted. Results: Unemployed or retired people had poor attitudes towards dementia and lower levels of knowledge about dementia. Single, cohabiting, or divorced people in Hong Kong and Macau had lower DAS scores than married people. Young people and those with a secondary education preferred to get their dementia information from social media. People with a tertiary education and employed people enjoyed searching government or hospital websites for information. Middle-aged, unemployed, or retired people tended to learn about dementia from television or radio. Conclusion: It is worth educating the public about dementia and developing strategies consistent with their preferences for types of mass media.

Human psychopharmacology	2022	train	9	6	1	Potential processes of change in MDMA-Assisted therapy for social anxiety disorder: Enhanced memory reconsolidation, self-transcendence, and therapeutic relationships.  OBJECTIVE: Researchers have suggested that psychotherapy may be enhanced by the addition of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), particularly in the treatment of disorders wherein interpersonal dysfunction is central, such as social anxiety disorder. We review literature pertaining to three potential processes of change that may be instigated during sessions involving MDMA administration in the treatment of social anxiety disorder. DESIGN: This is a narrative review that integrates research on the etiology and maintenance of social anxiety disorder and mechanisms of action of MDMA to examine how MDMA may enhance psychotherapy outcomes. RESULTS: We first outline how MDMA may enhance memory reconsolidation in social anxiety disorder. We then discuss how MDMA may induce experiences of self-transcendence and self-transcendent emotions such as compassion, love, and awe; and how these experiences may be therapeutic in the context of social anxiety disorder. We subsequently discuss the possibility that MDMA may enhance the strength and effectiveness of the therapeutic relationship which is a robust predictor of outcomes across many disorders as well as a potential key ingredient in treating disorders where shame and social disconnection are central factors. CONCLUSION: We discuss how processes of change may extend beyond the MDMA dosing sessions themselves.

Nigerian journal of medicine : journal of the National Association of Resident Doctors of Nigeria	2009	train	16	18	26	Classification and dramatic epidemic of diabetes mellitus in Kinshasa Hinterland: the prominent role of type 2 diabetes and lifestyle changes among Africans.  BACKGROUND: Classification of diabetes mellitus is not easily stated in Central Africa using the current diabetes classification of World Health Organization/American Diabetes Association. The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence, classification and risk factors of diabetes mellitus in Kinshasa Hinterland. METHODS: A multilevel and stratified random sample cross-sectional study included 9770 black Africans (4580 men and 5190 women) aged 12 years and above in urban metropolitan (Kinshasa city) and rural (Kikwit) areas. Participants were examined and administered a structured questionnaire and a capillary whole blood glucose test was done. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 46 +/- 15 years. Overall crude and age adjusted prevalences of diabetes were 25% (n = 2472) and 18%, respectively. Using WHO/ADA classification, Type diabetes (80%) was commoner than undetermined form (12%), Type 1B (3.5%), Type 1A (2.5%) and Other specific types (2%). According to plasma insulin and plasma C-peptide levels, participants with undetermined form were classified Type 2 diabetics. Thus, the rate of Type 2 diabetes among diabetics was estimated 92%. Urban location, age, abdominal obesity arterial hypertension, physical inactivity, inappropriate diet (lack of fruits-vegetables, refined sugar, animal fat and protein, starvation, social inequalities, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake were significantly and positively associated with diabetes in general and type 2 diabetes in particular. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of diabetes is due to the unexpected high rates of type 2 diabetes, aging, urbanization, and sedentary lifestyle consequences. The majority of risk factors of diabetes are potentially modifiable by primary prevention.

This paper examines the extent of physical and sexual abuse among runaway youths and the association of that abuse with behavior, mental health, life events, and parental mental health. Of 291 youths who sought shelter at homes for runaway youths, almost half (141) reported a history of physical or sexual abuse. The results emphasize the need that these abused youths and their parents have for mental health services: One in five of the nonabused youths and one in three of the abused youths endorsed parental descriptions reflective of antisocial personality and/or drug problems, and runaways who were abused had a mean level of behavior problems in the clinically significant area. Multivariate analyses demonstrate that the simple existence of physical or sexual abuse impacts on self-esteem and overall behavior problems regardless of other family problems.

At present, the only treatment for food allergy is to avoid the allergy-causing food until outgrowing the allergy. Recently, some trials of oral tolerance induction (oral immunotherapy) for milk, egg, or peanut allergy have been reported. We report here the experience of rush specific oral tolerance induction (rush SOTI) for 2 cases, an 8 year-old girl and a 6 year-old boy, with severe wheat allergy. In hospital, the positive reaction to wheat was identified by a double-blind placebo-controlled challenge test, and then the threshold dose of wheat was measured, and rush SOTI was started at the dose below the threshold, ingesting wheat (bread) 5 times a day at 30 minutes interval, increasing the dose by 20% every time. The goal of rush SOTI was set as 5.6 g of wheat protein. The girl achieved the goal on the 10th day, and the boy did on the 8th day. During the course, the girl experienced adverse reactions 9 times and the boy did 6 times, and these were treated with oral antihistamine or inhalation of salbutamol. After leaving hospital, they have been instructed to ingest the maintenance dose of wheat at least twice a week, and they are ingesting wheat without any problems for 6 months or for 3 months. We assume that rush SOTI is a safe and effective maneuver to tolerize children with wheat allergy, as well as egg or peanut allergy.

Rats could lever press 24 hours a day for 97 mg food pellets under a fixed-interval (FI) 90 second schedule. During the first 4 days, an ethanol solution was the only available fluid, after which both water and ethanol solutions were available. At ethanol concentrations (w/v) of 5%, 7.5% and l0%, total caloric intake and total fluid intake remained constant, while ethanol consumption was inversely proportional to the concentration of the solution. When the FI 90s schedule was changed to FI 45 s, or to FI 180 s, there were only small changes in total caloric intake, total fluid intake and in percentages of total fluid consumption and total caloric intake as ethanol. The data suggest that the intake of ethanol under this fixed-interval schedule depends more on the ethanol concentration than on the calories obtained from ethanol drinking.

Objective: To investigate the high-frequency hearing loss (HFHL) of workers in an automobile factory and its influencing factors, so as to provide a scientific basis for occupational health management of noise workers. Methods: From March to July 2019, 2647 workers from an automobile factory were selected as the research objects by cluster sampling method. The basic personal information (such as gender, age, education level, height, weight, etc.) , history of ear disease, the history of detonation, history of exposure to ototoxic drugs, history of exposure to occupational noise, etc., were investigated by questionnaire and occupational health examination. Chi-square test was used to compare the detection rates of HFHL in different populations, and multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the influencing factors of HFHL. Results: The noise level of 2647 individual workers ranged from 75.0 dB (A) to 92.0 dB (A) , with an average of (84.14+/-2.47) dB (A) . The detection rate of HFHL was 17.2% (456/2647) . There were significant differences in the the detection rate of HFHL among workers of different gender, age, educational level, working age, noise exposure level, diabetes history, detonation history, smoking and drinking workers (P<0.05) . Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that male, age >=30 years old, smoking and noise exposure were risk factors for HFHL (P<0.05) . Conclusion: The detection rate of HFHL in automobile factory workers is high. Gender, age, smoking and noise are the influencing factors of HFHL. It is necessary to strengthen the noise control in the workplace and guide workers to choose healthy lifestyle.  
22802608	Influence of sports, physical education, and active commuting to school on adolescent weight status.	Pediatrics	2012	train	20	8	10	Influence of sports, physical education, and active commuting to school on adolescent weight status.  OBJECTIVE: To compare the associations between weight status and different forms of physical activity among adolescents. METHODS: We conducted telephone surveys with 1718 New Hampshire and Vermont high school students and their parents as part of a longitudinal study of adolescent health. We surveyed adolescents about their team sports participation, other extracurricular physical activity, active commuting, physical education, recreational activity for fun, screen time, diet quality, and demographics. Overweight/obesity (BMI for age >= 85th percentile) and obesity (BMI for age >= 95 percentile) were based on self-reported height and weight. RESULTS: Overall, 29.0% (n = 498) of the sample was overweight/obese and 13.0% (n = 223) were obese. After adjustments, sports team participation was inversely related to overweight/obesity (relative risk [RR] = 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61, 0.87] for >2 sports teams versus 0) and obesity (RR = 0.61 [95% CI: 0.45, 0.81] for >2 sports teams versus 0). Additionally, active commuting to school was inversely related to obesity (RR = 0.67 [95% CI: 0.45, 0.99] for >3.5 days per week versus 0). Attributable risk estimates suggest obesity prevalence would decrease by 26.1% (95% CI: 9.4%, 42.8%) if all adolescents played on 2 sports teams per year and by 22.1% (95% CI: 0.1%, 43.3%) if all adolescents walked/biked to school at least 4 days per week. CONCLUSIONS: Team sport participation had the strongest and most consistent inverse association with weight status. Active commuting to school may reduce the risk of obesity, but not necessarily overweight, and should be studied further. Obesity prevention programs should consider strategies to increase team sport participation among all students.

Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition	2013	train	16	9	9	Associations between uterine fibroids and lifestyles including diet, physical activity and stress: a case-control study in China.  This study was conducted to investigate the associations between uterine fibroids and lifestyles including diet, physical activity and stress from October 2009 to April 2011 in China. This case-control study composed of 73 women with uterine fibroids and 210 women without fibroids. Uterine fibroid cases were confirmed by ultrasound diagnosis or hysterectomy surgery. Information on women's dietary habits, physical activity and stress status were collected with a validated self-administered questionnaire. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) after controlling for age, gravidity and parity. We found that vegetable and fruit intakes and occupational intensity played positive effects on uterine fibroids. For premenopausal women, vegetable and fruit intakes (OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.9) and occupational intensity (OR = 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1, 0.6) significantly decreased the risk of fibroids; conversely, BMI significantly increased the risk (OR = 1.2; 95% CI: 1.0, 1.4). However, the associations for postmenopausal women were not significant. Our findings suggested protective roles for vegetable and fruit intakes and occupational intensity on uterine fibroids, and supported the hypothesis that high BMI only increased the risk of uterine fibroids in premenopausal women.

Wei sheng yan jiu = Journal of hygiene research	2019	train	43	13	18	[Association of pickled food, fired food and smoked food combined with smoking and alcohol drinking with lung cancer: a case-control study].  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of pickled food,fried food and smoked food combined with smoking and alcohol drinking with lung cancer. METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted. A total of 1902 cases(24-90 years old) diagnosed in the Union Hospital and First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University and Fuzhou General Hospital of Nanjing Military Region and 2026(23-87 years old) controls matched healthy populaition for age(+/-3 ages) and gender from January 2006 to December 2013. Unconditional Logistic regression was used to analyze the combined effects and interactions of pickled food, fried food and smoked food with smoking and drinking, and to explore their relationship with the risk of lung cancer. RESULTS: The result of unconditional Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that fried food and smoked food were risk factors of lung cancer. Compare with the people whose fired food intake<3 times/week, the people whose fired food intake >=3 times/week had a 2. 954-folds increased lung cancer risk(95% CI 2. 065-4. 226). Compare with the people whose smoked food intake<3 times/week, the people whose smoked food intake >=3 times/week had a 6. 774-folds increased lung cancer risk(95% CI 3. 309-13. 866). The result of combined effect demonstrated that compare with the non-smoking drinker whose food intake score was 0, the smoking drinker whose food intake score was 1 had a 2. 108-folds increased lung cancer risk(95% CI 1. 551-2. 865); compare with the non-smoking drinker whose food intake score was 0, the smoking drinker whose food intake score >=2 had a 2. 191-folds increased lung cancer risk(95% CI 1. 377-3. 484). The result of interaction analysis demenstrated that intake of two or three kinds of risky food(>=1 time/week) increased the risk of lung cancer(OR = 1. 309, 95% CI 1. 010-1. 696) and it was more dangerous to smokers and drinkers. As for smokers, intake of two or three kinds of risky food was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in an exposure-response manner(Ptrend<0. 001). CONCLUSION: The intake of fried food and smoked food are independent risk factors of lung cancer. In addition, the pickled food, fried food and smoked food have combined effects on smoking and alcohol drinking, and the risk of lung cancer increases when the risk factors are present. The intake of the three kinds of risky food increases the risk of lung cancer in smokers.  
7313394	Sensorimotor electroencephalogram rhythmic activity: a functional gate mechanism.	Sleep	1981	train	2	0	0	"Sensorimotor electroencephalogram rhythmic activity: a functional gate mechanism.  Neurophysiological evidence for a negative feedback loop in somatosensory thalamic nuclei has provided a basis for understanding the origins of rhythmic activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of sensorimotor cortex. Studies reviewed here suggest that state-specific activation of this mechanism is responsible both for a variable pattern of rhythmic frequencies during wakefulness and the spindle burst pattern during sleep. It is proposed further that these rhythms index immobility and a common set of physiological changes in sensorimotor function, including reduced excitability in both afferent and efferent pathways. It is hypothesized, therefore, that the closing of a thalamic ""inhibitory gate"" is indicated by the occurrence of these rhythms. While a greater resolution of specific relationships is necessary, the study of these EEG patterns clearly provides a measure of complex physiological events in the nervous system, and can be also useful in identifying functional abnormalities.

24740024	Outcomes of breast reconstruction in breast cancer patients with a history of mantle radiation for Hodgkin lymphoma.	Annals of plastic surgery	2014	train	18	9	3	Outcomes of breast reconstruction in breast cancer patients with a history of mantle radiation for Hodgkin lymphoma.  BACKGROUND: Although mantle radiation (ie, extended field radiation) represented the standard of care in the past for Hodgkin disease, contemporary treatment of lymphoma consists of a multimodal approach with chemotherapy. Patients who were exposed to mantle radiation have a higher risk of breast cancer and are more susceptible to postoperative complications after breast reconstruction due to radiation. In this study, we present postoperative outcomes in patients with a history of mantle radiation who underwent mastectomy and breast reconstruction. METHODS: All patients at Stanford University Medical Center between January 2006 and December 2012 with a history of Hodgkin lymphoma treated with mantle radiation who received breast reconstruction were identified. A retrospective chart review was conducted analyzing patient demographics, history of Hodgkin treatment, type of reconstruction, follow-up, and complications. Complications were further classified into medical complications, donor-site complications, and recipient-site complications. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with a history of Hodgkin disease and mantle radiation received breast reconstruction. The average age of the patients at their mastectomy was 46 (33-60) years, with the average age at the time of their mantle radiation of 20.5 (10-33) years with an average interval of radiation to breast cancer treatment of 24.8 (16-38) years. There were five unilateral and 11 bilateral reconstructions. All patients had immediate reconstruction with tissue expanders (14 patients) or autologous tissue (one muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous and one transverse upper gracilis flap). Eleven (69%) patients had postoperative complications. In the patients who had tissue expander reconstruction, there was an overall complication rate of 64%, which included capsular contracture (n=5, 56%), mastectomy flap necrosis (n=5, 56%), cellulitis (n=4, 44%), seroma (n=3, 33%), hematoma (n=1, 11%), and chronic pain (n=1, 11%). Three (two unilateral and one bilateral) tissue expander infections required removal of the expander and delayed reconstruction with a latissimus dorsi flap, whereas one patient with chronic pain and capsular contracture required a muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous for a unilateral implant failure. CONCLUSIONS: Although the risk of complications associated with preoperative radiation is well documented, physicians and patients should be cognizant of the increased risk of complications after mantle radiation as it represents a unique modality of radiation exposure.  
25527662	Obesity is associated with increased red blood cell folate despite lower dietary intakes and serum concentrations.	The Journal of nutrition	2015	train	4	7	1	Obesity is associated with increased red blood cell folate despite lower dietary intakes and serum concentrations.  BACKGROUND: Folates are essential cofactors in metabolic pathways that facilitate biological methylation and nucleotide synthesis, and therefore have widespread effects on health and diseases. Although obesity is prevalent worldwide, few studies have investigated how obesity interacts with folate status. OBJECTIVE: Based on data from the NHANES, this study aims to examine the association between body mass index (BMI) and obesity-related metabolic factors with blood folate status. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 3767 adults from the NHANES (2003-2006) was used as the study population. Regression analyses, with and without adjustment for demographic factors and dietary intakes, were performed to examine associations between BMI and metabolic factors with serum and RBC folate. RESULTS: The results indicate serum folate concentrations were lower in obese groups compared to the desirable BMI and overweight categories, paralleling lower intakes in this group. In contrast, RBC folate increased incrementally with BMI. Regression analyses demonstrated an inverse relation between BMI and serum folate but a positive relation for RBC folate (P < 0.01). Waist circumference, serum triglycerides, and fasting plasma glucose each displayed significant positive relations with RBC folate (P < 0.01), although relations with serum folate were not significant and consistent. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, obesity is associated with decreased serum folate, which parallels decreased folate intakes. In contrast, obesity is positively associated with RBC folate. Therefore, RBC folate, in addition to serum folate, should also be considered as a critical biomarker for folate status, especially in the obese population. Future research is needed to understand how obesity differentially alters serum and RBC folate status because they are associated with a variety of medical complications.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the relationships between sleep duration, dietary patterns and overweight/obesity among adolescents in Xuzhou, and to develop prevention and intervention strategies for adolescent-obesity. METHODS: Data of 3 103 boys and girls from 5 junior high schools were analyzed. Self-reported information on duration of sleep, dietary patterns, physical activities and time spent on watching video/audio program were assessed and physique data was also collected. Descriptive statistics, multiple liner regression and logistic regression models were used. RESULTS: The prevalence rates on overweight and obesity in boys were 23.5% and 22.5% , and in girls were 18.1% and 11.9%, respectively. Proportions of insufficient sleep (<8 h/d) in boys appeared 28.1% and in girls as 33.0% . From logistic regression analysis revealed that there appeared risk on the prevalence of overweight and obesity in boys who had sleep duration <7 h/d [OR(95% CI):1.72 (1.08-2.74)], but no significant association was found between duration of sleep and overweight/ obesity in girls. After adjusting on age, levels of parental education, family income, physical activities, time spent on watching video/audio programs, and weight status, boys who had sleep duration less than 7 h/d would have the odds ratio of 1.69 (1.10-2.73), for the likelihood of increasing the frequency of eating snacks compared to their counterparts who had sleep duration of >= 8 h/d. CONCLUSION: The Shortened duration of sleep seemed an independent risk factor on overweight/obesity among male adolescents, and it was associated with the increased frequency of eating snacks. Data from our study showed that the dietary patterns might play a role in the association between duration of sleep and overweight/ obesity, among male adolescents.

The current investigation hypothesized and tested latent bully/victim traits for physical, verbal, or relational bullying/victimization, both cyber and traditional behaviors. Data were collected from 1,356 German students who attended Grades 5 to 10: 48.4% males, 49.3% females from eight different schools in Northern Germany. Based on two samples for cross-validation (Ntraining set = 525, Nvalidation set = 525), study findings provided strong evidence of adequate model fit, both for traditional and cyber behaviors. Consistent with the current state of knowledge, bullying and victimization latent traits highly associated, more so for cyber behaviors than traditional ones. Thus, both the theoretical plausibility as well as statistical evidence support the application of latent modeling to these behaviors. Further research is needed to replicate the applied measurement models proposed in this work and to reveal moderators or measurement invariance across diverse populations. Nevertheless, the current evidence substantiates the importance of the application of a latent modeling approach to overcome known psychometric challenges of reliability and validity in bullying research.

Plant foods for human nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands)	2014	train	20	1	0	Phenolic composition, antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities of Eryngium bornmuelleri leaf.  Eryngium bornmuelleri Nab. (Tusi) is an endemic botanical from the Eastern Anatolia region of Turkey traditionally used for preparation of herbal tea. Within this study, phenolic composition, antioxidant capacities and inhibitory activities towards selected digestive enzymes of E. bornmuelleri leaf were investigated. Sequential extracts, obtained by extraction of plant tissue by ethanol, acetone and water exhibited pronounced antioxidant capacities and in a dose-dependent manner suppressed the metabolic syndrome related enzymes: alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase. All extracts contained high levels of phenolic compounds. Flavonoid glycosides were the main phytochemicals detected, with rutin as the major compound (70% of total phenolics). Chlorogenic, hydroxybenzoic and caftaric acids as well as traces of caffeic, ferulic and rosmarinic acids were also detected. Correlation analysis indicated that phenolic compounds were the major sources of the enzyme-inhibitory activities. This study suggests that E. bornmuelleri leaf extracts can modulate the metabolism of sugars and fats through inhibition of the relevant digestive enzymes.  
33512698	Can High-Intensity Interval Training Promote Skeletal Muscle Anabolism?	Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)	2021	train	15	0	0	Can High-Intensity Interval Training Promote Skeletal Muscle Anabolism?  Exercise training in combination with optimal nutritional support is an effective strategy to maintain or increase skeletal muscle mass. A single bout of resistance exercise undertaken with adequate protein availability increases rates of muscle protein synthesis and, when repeated over weeks and months, leads to increased muscle fiber size. While resistance-based training is considered the 'gold standard' for promoting muscle hypertrophy, other modes of exercise may be able to promote gains in muscle mass. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) comprises short bouts of exercise at or above the power output/speed that elicits individual maximal aerobic capacity, placing high tensile stress on skeletal muscle, and somewhat resembling the demands of resistance exercise. While HIIT induces rapid increases in skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, the anabolic potential of HIIT for promoting concurrent gains in muscle mass and cardiorespiratory fitness has received less scientific inquiry. In this review, we discuss studies that have determined muscle growth responses after HIIT, with a focus on molecular responses, that provide a rationale for HIIT to be implemented among populations who are susceptible to muscle loss (e.g. middle-aged or older adults) and/or in clinical settings (e.g. pre- or post-surgery).

The Journal of clinical psychiatry	2009	train	8	21	3	Relationship of nicotine dependence, subsyndromal and pathological gambling, and other psychiatric disorders: data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions.  OBJECTIVE: Nicotine dependence frequently co-occurs with subsyndromal and pathological levels of gambling. The relationship of nicotine dependence, levels of gambling pathology, and other psychiatric disorders, however, is incompletely understood. METHOD: To use nationally representative data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions to examine the influence of DSM-IV nicotine dependence on the association between pathological gambling severities and other psychiatric disorders. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 43,093 adults living in households and group-quarters in the United States. The main outcome measure was the co-occurrence of current nicotine dependence and Axis I and II disorders and severity of gambling based on the 10 inclusionary diagnostic criteria for pathological gambling. The study was conducted from 2001 to 2002. RESULTS: Among non-nicotine-dependent respondents, increasing gambling severity was associated with greater psychopathology for the majority of Axis I and II disorders. This pattern was not uniformly observed among nicotine-dependent subjects. Significant nicotine-by-gambling-group interactions were observed for multiple Axis I and II disorders. All significant interactions involved stronger associations between gambling and psychopathology in the non-nicotine-dependent group. CONCLUSIONS: In a large national sample, nicotine dependence influences the associations between gambling and multiple psychiatric disorders. Subsyndromal levels of gambling are associated with significant psychopathology. Nicotine dependence accounts for some of the elevated risks for psychopathology associated with subsyndromal and problem/pathological levels of gambling. Additional research is needed to examine specific prevention and treatment for individuals with problem/pathological gambling with and without nicotine dependence.  
11687197	Antidepressants versus psychological treatments and their combination for bulimia nervosa.	The Cochrane database of systematic reviews	2001	train	16	5	2	Antidepressants versus psychological treatments and their combination for bulimia nervosa.  BACKGROUND: Psychotherapeutic approaches, mainly cognitive behavior therapy, and antidepressant medication are the two treatment modalities that have received most support in controlled outcome studies of bulimia nervosa. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to conduct a systematic review of all RCTs comparing antidepressants with psychological approaches or comparing their combination with each single approach for the treatment of bulimia nervosa. SEARCH STRATEGY: (1) electronic searches of MEDLINE (1966 to December 2000), EMBASE (1980-December 2000), PsycLIT (to December 2000), LILACS & SCISEARCH (to 1999) (2) the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register - ongoing (3) handsearches of the references of all identified trials (4) contact with the pharmaceutical companies and the principal investigator of each included trial (5) handsearch of the International Journal of Eating Disorders - ongoing INCLUSION CRITERIA: every randomized controlled trial in which antidepressants were compared with psychological treatments or the combination of antidepressants with psychological approaches was compared to each treatment alone, to reduce the symptoms of bulimia nervosa in patients of any age or gender. Quality criteria: reports were considered adequate if they were classified as A or B according to the Cochrane Manual. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted independently by two reviewers for each included trial. The main outcome for efficacy was full remission of bulimic symptoms, defined as 100% reduction in binge or purge episodes from baseline to endpoint. Dichotomous data was evaluated by the relative risks and 95% confidence intervals around this measure, based on the random effects model; continuous data was evaluated by the average difference and the 95% confidence interval. Number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH) were calculated using the inverse of the absolute risk reduction. MAIN RESULTS: Five trials were included in comparison one (antidepressants versus psychological treatments), five in comparison two (antidepressants versus the combination) and seven in comparison three (psychological treatments versus the combination). Remission rates were 20% for single antidepressants compared to 39% for single psychotherapy (DerSimonian-Laird Relative Risk = 1.28; 95% Confidence Interval = 0.98;1.67). Dropout rates were higher for antidepressants than for psychotherapy (DerSimonian-Laird Relative Risk = 2.18; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.09;4.35). The NNH for a mean treatment duration of 17.5 weeks was 4 (95% confidence interval = 3;11). Comparison two found remission rates of 42% for the combination versus 23% for antidepressants (DerSimonian-Laird Relative Risk = 1.38; 95% Confidence Interval = 0.98;1.93). Comparison three showed a 36% pooled remission rate for psychological approaches compared to 49% for the combination (DerSimonian-Laird Relative Risk = 1.21; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.02;1.45). The NNT for a mean treatment duration of 15 weeks was 8 (95% Confidence Interval = 4;320). Dropout rates were higher for the combination compared to single psychological treatments (DerSimonian-Laird Relative Risk = 0.57; 95% Confidence Interval = 0.38;0.88). The NNH was 7 (95% Confidence Interval = 4;21). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Using a more conservative statistical approach, combination treatments were superior to single psychotherapy. This was the only statistically significant difference between treatments. The number of trials might be insufficient to show the statistical significance of a 19% absolute risk reduction in efficacy favouring psychotherapy or combination treatments over single antidepressants. Psychotherapy appeared to be more acceptable to subjects. When antidepressants were combined to psychological treatments, acceptability of the latter was significantly reduced.

Nihon Arukoru Yakubutsu Igakkai zasshi = Japanese journal of alcohol studies & drug dependence	2003	train	12	35	2	[Alcoholic liver diseases in Japan and modification by hepatitis virus].  Recently incidence of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) has been increasing in Japan associated with an increase in alcoholic beverage consumption. There have been a large number of reports about the relationship between alcohol and hepatocarcinogenesis, but it remains controversial. In this review, we addressed 1) the recent trend in incidence of ALD including severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH), liver cirrhosis (LC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in heavy drinkers in Japan, and 2) the characteristics of HCC in heavy drinkers with negative serum markers for viral hepatitis. We carried out nation-wide survey by asking for the hospitals that are approved by the Japanese Society of Gastroenterology for recent aspects of in-patients with ALD. Except for HCC, percentage of ALD without viral hepatitis is more than 70%, which is increased when compared to the national survey carried out in 1992. Percentage of alcoholic LC without positive markers for viral hepatitis was 61% and alcohol plus virus group was 39%. Furthermore, in alcoholic LC patients without HCC, those who did not have viral hepatitis were 80%. However, the percentage of HCC without viral hepatitis was 27% of all of the heavy drinkers with HCC. Regarding our own cases, subjects were 432 HCC patients who were admitted to our hospital since 1995. There were 296 cases (68.5%) of HCV-positive, 70 cases (16.2%) of HBV-positive, 27 cases (6.3%) of both HCV- and HBV-positive. Thirty-nine cases (6.7%) were negative for serum markers for viral hepatitis. Among them, 13 cases (3.0%) were not heavy drinkers (non-B, non-C, non-alcohol) and 26 cases (6.0%) were heavy drinkers (non-B, non-C, heavy drinkers). Twenty-five of these 26 (96.2%) cases had cirrhosis. In conclusion, since the consumption of alcohol is increasing in Japan, the frequency and number of cases of alcoholic liver cirrhosis are increasing. Viral hepatitis infection, however, still plays an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis in heavy drinkers. Radiographic examinations at an appropriate interval for HCC are recommended, even in cases with alcoholic liver cirrhosis who are negative for serum markers of viral hepatitis, to ensure the early diagnosis of HCC.

To examine the context of sexual assault and postassault actions and consequences among women attending historically Black colleges or universities (HBCUs), web-based surveys were administered in November 2008 to 3,951 undergraduate women attending four HBCUs. Data on the context in which assaults occurred were generated for women who had been sexually assaulted since entering college (n = 358). Multivariate models were run on the full sample to examine the association between sexual assault and symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Results indicated that most survivors were assaulted by assailants well known to them and when the survivor and perpetrator were drinking alcohol. Very few survivors disclosed their experiences to formal sources of support. Survivors had significantly more symptoms of depression and were more likely to screen positive for PTSD than nonvictims. Further research on disclosure and its moderating role on the mental health consequences of sexual assault is needed.

BMC musculoskeletal disorders	2014	train	13	12	0	Effect of intermittent aerobic exercise on sleep quality and sleep disturbances in patients with rheumatoid arthritis - design of a randomized controlled trial.  BACKGROUND: Poor sleep is prevalent in patients with systemic inflammatory disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, and, in addition to fatigue, pain, depression and inflammation, is associated with an increased risk of co-morbidity and all-cause mortality. Whereas non-pharmacological interventions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis have been shown to reduce pain and fatigue, no randomized controlled trials have examined the effect of non-pharmacological interventions on improvement of sleep in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of an intermittent aerobic exercise intervention on sleep, assessed both objectively and subjectively in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial including 44 patients with rheumatoid arthritis randomly assigned to an exercise training intervention or to a control group. The intervention consists of 18 session intermittent aerobic exercise training on a bicycle ergometer three times a week. Patients are evaluated according to objective changes in sleep as measured by polysomnography (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes include changes in subjective sleep quality and sleep disturbances, fatigue, pain, depressive symptoms, physical function, health-related quality of life and cardiorespiratory fitness. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide evidence of the effect of intermittent aerobic exercise on the improvement of sleep in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, which is considered important in promotion of health and well-being. As such, the trial meets a currently unmet need for the provision of non-pharmacological treatment initiatives of poor sleep in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

23391765	Acute effect of ambient air pollution on stroke mortality in the China air pollution and health effects study.	Stroke	2013	train	17	9	5	Acute effect of ambient air pollution on stroke mortality in the China air pollution and health effects study.  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There have been no multicity studies on the acute effects of air pollution on stroke mortality in China. This study was undertaken to examine the associations between daily stroke mortality and outdoor air pollution (particulate matter <10 mum in aerodynamic diameter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide) in 8 Chinese cities. METHODS: We used Poisson regression models with natural spline-smoothing functions to adjust for long-term and seasonal trends, as well as other time-varying covariates. We applied 2-stage Bayesian hierarchical statistical models to estimate city-specific and national average associations of air pollution with daily stroke mortality. RESULTS: Air pollution was associated with daily stroke mortality in 8 Chinese cities. In the combined analysis, an increase of 10 mug/m(3) of 2-day moving average concentrations of particulate matter <10 mum in aerodynamic diameter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide corresponded to 0.54% (95% posterior intervals, 0.28-0.81), 0.88% (95% posterior intervals, 0.54-1.22), and 1.47% (95% posterior intervals, 0.88-2.06) increase of stroke mortality, respectively. The concentration-response curves indicated linear nonthreshold associations between air pollution and risk of stroke mortality. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first multicity study in China, or even in other developing countries, to report the acute effect of air pollution on stroke mortality. Our results contribute to very limited data on the effect of air pollution on stroke for high-exposure settings typical in developing countries.

International journal of food sciences and nutrition	2015	train	29	0	0	Analysis of trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid in vegetable foods using high-performance liquid chromatography.  Trans-resveratrol and resveratrol glucoside are natural phenolic compounds existed in a wide variety of plant species, which are extensively consumed in many countries. The existing studies excessively focused on grapes and their products, and little about daily vegetable foods. Actually, in much more countries, vegetable foods are residents' principal food and nutrient origins. This study was to investigate the levels of trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid in daily vegetable foods of China using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with fluorescence detection (FLD). Trans-piceid was the major form existing in most vegetable foods, and most of the samples contained higher trans-piceid than trans-resveratrol. The contents of trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid in different varieties and regions were different. Moreover, peculiar vegetable foods to some region were also one of the most important sources of trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid. Therefore, vegetable foods were other significant sources of trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid except the foods published.  
32681981	Sleep duration patterns from adolescence to young adulthood and the risk of asthma.	Annals of epidemiology	2020	train	9	8	2	Sleep duration patterns from adolescence to young adulthood and the risk of asthma.  PURPOSE: This study examined the association between sleep duration trajectories from adolescence to young adulthood and the risk of asthma into young adulthood. METHODS: Using data from 10,362 participants in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) free of asthma at baseline, we constructed trajectories of sleep duration from adolescence (age 13-18 years) to young adulthood (age 24-32 years) and used them to examine the association between sleep duration patterns and the risk of new-onset asthma using a log-binomial regression model after adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: The results revealed that 14.4% of nonasthmatic participants had persistent short sleep duration, whereas 80.0% had adequate sleep duration from adolescence through young adulthood. Consistently short-sleepers had 1.52 times the risk of new-onset asthma by age 32 years (95% CI 1.11, 2.10) compared with consistently adequate sleepers. The association was stronger in those with a family history of asthma (aRR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.15, 5.13) than in those without such history (aRR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.05, 1.95). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that persistent short sleep duration is associated with an increased risk of new-onset asthma in young adults. This association may be more pronounced among those at high risk of asthma because of family history.

Journal of internal medicine	2007	train	12	9	3	Long-term use of Swedish moist snuff and the risk of myocardial infarction amongst men.  BACKGROUND: The scientific evidence on cardiovascular risks associated with long-term use of snuff is limited and inconclusive. The use of this smokeless tobacco has increased in recent decades, and adverse health effects associated with snuff use could be of great public health concern. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study whether long-term use of snuff affects the risk of myocardial infarction. DESIGN: Between 1978 and 1993 all construction workers in Sweden were offered repeated health check-ups by the Swedish Construction Industry's Organization for Working Environment Safety and Health. A cohort was created with information on tobacco use and other risk factors, collected through questionnaires. SETTING: In total, 118,395 nonsmoking men without a history of myocardial infarction were followed through 2004. Information on myocardial infarction morbidity and mortality was obtained from national registers. Relative risk estimates were derived from Cox proportional hazards regression model, with adjustment for age, body mass index and region of residence. RESULTS: Almost 30% of the men had used snuff. In total, 118 395 nonsmoking men without a history of myocardial infarction were followed through 2004. The multivariable-adjusted relative risks for ever snuff users were 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.02) for nonfatal cases and 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.55) for fatal cases. Heavy users (>or=50 g day(-1)) had a relative risk of fatal myocardial infarction of 1.96 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.58). Snuff use increased the probability of mortality from cardiovascular disease amongst nonfatal myocardial infarction patients. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that snuff use is associated with an increased risk of fatal myocardial infarction.

Diabetes & metabolism journal	2018	train	20	8	6	Impact of Socioeconomic Status on Health Behaviors, Metabolic Control, and Chronic Complications in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.  BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to assess the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on health behaviors, metabolic control, and chronic complications in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from South Korea, a country with universal health insurance coverage and that has experienced rapid economic and social transition. METHODS: A total of 3,294 Korean men and women with T2DM aged 30 to 65 years, participating in the Korean National Diabetes Program (KNDP) cohort who reported their SES and had baseline clinical evaluation were included in the current cross-sectional analysis. SES included the level of education and monthly household income. RESULTS: Lower education level and lower income level were closely related, and both were associated with older age in men and women. Women and men with lower income and education level had higher carbohydrate and lower fat intake. After adjustment for possible confounding factors, higher education in men significantly lowered the odds of having uncontrolled hyperglycemia (glycosylated hemoglobin >=7.5%) (odds ratio [OR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.91 for highest education; P(trend)=0.048), while higher household income in men significantly lowered the odds of having diabetic retinopathy (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.95 for highest income level; P(trend)=0.048). In women, lower income was associated with a higher stress level. CONCLUSION: Men with lower SES had higher odds of having diabetic retinopathy and uncontrolled hyperglycemia, showing the need to improve care targeted to this population.  
27918700	The Associations Between Urbanicity and Physical Activity and Sitting Time in Mexico.	Journal of physical activity & health	2017	train	23	0	0	The Associations Between Urbanicity and Physical Activity and Sitting Time in Mexico.  BACKGROUND: Approximately 17.4% of people in Mexico self-report physical activity levels below the World Health Organization's guidelines and an average sedentary time of 16 hours per day.(1) Low physical activity has been associated with noncommunicable disease risk factors and previous research suggests that urbanicity might be an important determinant of physical activity. The aim of this study was to measure urbanicity in Mexico and assess if it is associated with physical activity and sitting time. METHODS: A sample of 2880 men and 4211 women aged 20 to 69 was taken from the 2012 Mexico National Health and Nutrition Survey and multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the association between physical activity, sitting time and urbanicity; adjusting for sex, education level, socioeconomic status and Body Mass Index. The urbanicity score and the 7 urbanicity subscores were estimated from the CENSUS 2010. RESULTS: The subscores of demographic, economic activity, diversity and communication were negatively associated with physical activity. Sitting time was positively associated with the overall urbanicity, and the demographic and health subscores. CONCLUSIONS: There was evidence of associations between urbanicity and physical activity in Mexico.  
25561966	Lipid and glucose serum levels in children with congenital heart disease.	The journal of Tehran Heart Center	2014	train	1	10	0	Lipid and glucose serum levels in children with congenital heart disease.  INTRODUCTION: Coronary artery disease is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. Atherosclerosis begins in early childhood and progresses through life. With advances in pediatric cardiology, the prevalence of congenital heart disease in adults has increased in relation to children. A great deal of research has been conducted on serum glucose and lipid concentrations in patients with congenital heart disease, but comparison has yet to be made between congenital patients and the general population, especially in pediatric groups. The aim of this study was to compare the serum concentrations of glucose and lipids between pediatric congenital heart disease patients and a healthy age and sex-matched control group. METHODS: We measured and compared the total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and plasma glucose concentrations of 100 pediatric congenital heart disease patients (cases) and 100 individuals matched for age and sex (controls) during a period of 7 months between November 2011 and June 2012. RESULTS: Total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher in the patients than in the control group (p value < 0.05). Blood sugar levels in both groups had no significant difference (p value = 0.25). In the case group, the cholesterol level was higher in the males than in the females (p value = 0.30); moreover, the TG and HDL cholesterol levels were lower in the males than in the females and the LDL cholesterol and blood sugar levels had no statistically significant difference. In the control group, there was no difference between the males and females in terms of the cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, TG, and blood sugar levels. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that our pediatric congenital heart disease patients had significantly higher levels of serum lipids than did their age and sex-matched controls. In light of these results, we recommend that the lipid profile be screened in children with congenital heart disease so as to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis.

AIMS: The Diabetes Community Lifestyle Improvement Program (D-CLIP) aims to implement and evaluate in a controlled, randomized trial the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of a culturally appropriate, low-cost, and sustainable lifestyle intervention for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus in India. METHODS: D-CLIP, a translational research project adapted from the methods and curriculum developed and tested for efficacy in the Diabetes Prevention Program, utilizes innovated methods (a step-wise model of diabetes prevention with lifestyle and metformin added when needed; inclusion of individuals with isolated glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, and both; classes team-taught by professionals and trained community educators) with the goals of increasing diabetes prevention, community acceptability, and long-term dissemination and sustainability of the program. The study outcomes are: diabetes incidence (primary measure of effectiveness), cost-effectiveness, changes in anthropometric measures, plasma lipids, blood pressure, blood glucose, and HbA(1c,) Program acceptability and sustainability will be assessed using a mixed methods approach. CONCLUSION: D-CLIP, a low-cost, community-based, research program, addresses the key components of translational research and can be used as a model for prevention of chronic diseases in other low and middle-income country settings.  
22809777	Background exposure to persistent organic pollutants predicts stroke in the elderly.	Environment international	2012	train	15	8	11	Background exposure to persistent organic pollutants predicts stroke in the elderly.  Background exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs), lipophilic xenobiotics that accumulate mainly in adipose tissue, has recently emerged as a new risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. This prospective study was performed to evaluate if plasma concentrations of selected POPs predict incident stroke among the elderly. Twenty-one POPs (including 16 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, 3 organochlorine (OC) pesticides, 1 brominated diphenyl ether (BDE), and 1 dioxin) were measured in plasma collected at baseline in 898 participants aged 70 years of the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS). Stroke diagnosis was validated by hospital records. During the five year follow-up, 35 subjects developed hospital-treated stroke. After adjusting for known stroke risk factors, most PCBs with 4, 5, or 6 chlorine atoms, p,p'-DDE, trans-nonachlor, and octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin significantly predicted the risk of stroke. Across quartiles of summary measures of PCBs and OC pesticides, the adjusted ORs were 1.0, 0.8 (95% confidence interval: 0.2-2.5), 1.2 (0.4-3.4), and 2.1 (0.7-6.2) for PCBs and 1.0, 1.2 (0.3-4.2), 2.3 (0.7-6.9), and 3.0 (1.0-9.4) for OC pesticides (P for trend=0.11 and 0.03, respectively). The adjusted ORs among participants >= 90th percentile of the summary measures were 5.5 (1.7-18.1) for PCBs and 4.0 (1.1-14.6) for OC pesticides; corresponding ORs for those >= 95th percentile were 7.8 (2.1-29.6) and 9.5 (2.3-38.9). Background exposure to POPs may play an important role in development or progression of stroke in the elderly.

PURPOSE: The first aim of this study was to compare nighttime voiding frequency (nocturia), serum hemoglobin A1c level, peripheral neuropathy score, and global sleep quality score in younger (>40 to <65 years) versus older (>=65 years) women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Additional aims were to identify factors associated with clinically relevant nocturia (>=2 episodes/night) and to analyze relationships between nocturia frequency, glycemic control, peripheral neuropathy, and sleep quality in these women. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Participants were 118 women older than 40 years and with type 2 DM. Their mean age was 65.25 (SD = 9.66) years; the mean duration since diagnosis of type 2 DM was 10.96 (SD = 7.66) years. The study setting was 2 metabolism and endocrinology outpatient departments located in Taipei City and Taoyuan, Taiwan. METHODS: Data were collected using a questionnaire that queried sociodemographic information, lower urinary tract symptoms, and sleep quality. We also assessed peripheral neuropathy and lower extremity edema and obtained pertinent information from participants' medical records. Independent t tests, multivariate logistic regression analyses, Spearman's rank correlation coefficients, and one-way analysis of variance were used to address the 3 study aims. RESULTS: Analyses found that older women (aged >=65 years) had a significantly higher nighttime voiding frequency, a higher peripheral neuropathy score, and a higher sleep quality score than younger (>40 to <65 years) women. Multivariate logistic regression analyses identified 4 factors associated with clinically relevant nocturia advanced age, elevated hemoglobin A1c level, suspected peripheral neuropathy, and lower extremity edema. Significant correlation coefficients were found between nighttime voiding frequency and serum hemoglobin A1c levels, peripheral neuropathy scores, and sleep quality scores. Analyses also found that women with a greater nocturia frequency had higher hemoglobin A1c levels, peripheral neuropathy scores, and sleep quality scores. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals should screen for nocturia in women with type 2 DM and provide appropriate management for those experiencing nocturia.  
25677603	Improving oral health of institutionalized older people with diagnosed dementia.	Aging & mental health	2016	train	11	10	1	Improving oral health of institutionalized older people with diagnosed dementia.  OBJECTIVE: Previous research has revealed poor oral hygiene and health among older people suffering from dementia. To evaluate the oral health and denture hygiene of older people with and without dementia, six months after carer have followed a dental education programme. METHOD: Ninety-three older people living in four long-term care homes in south-western Germany were included in this longitudinal cohort study. All participants were allocated into two groups on basis of the medical dementia diagnosis extracted from the medical records in the care documentation: suffering from dementia (n = 33) or not (n = 60). For each participant plaque control record, gingival bleeding index (GBI), community periodontal index of treatment needs (CPITN), and denture hygiene index (DHI) were assessed at baseline and six months after carer have followed a dental education programme, and after use of ultrasonic devices for denture cleaning. Differences between all target variables from baseline to follow-up, and between participants with and without dementia, were evaluated by bivariate and multivariate testing. RESULTS: In bivariate testing, participants with dementia had a significantly lower DHI (p < 0.001), a lower GBI (p < 0.05), and a lower CPITN (p < 0.01) at follow-up. In participants without dementia, only for DHI (p < 0.001) a significant improvement was observed. In multivariate analyses, the significant association could not be reproduced (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Use of ultrasonic baths can be a successful means for improving denture hygiene among older people in long-term care with and without dementia. Education for carer in order to improve oral hygiene, however, seems to be of minor significance and to be more effective for people with dementia.  
31095224	[Vitamin D and pediatrics respiratory diseases].	Revista chilena de pediatria	2019	train	8	13	2	[Vitamin D and pediatrics respiratory diseases].  The better understanding of the global activity of vitamin D has led to an intense search for its involvement in non-skeletal diseases. This article presents an updated review of the relationship between vitamin D and pediatric respiratory pathology. A literature search was performed in PUBMED using free terms and MESH terms: vitamin D, asthma, respiratory system diseases, and bronchiolitis. Stu dies in human patients younger than 18 years and animals, published in English and Spanish until 2017 were included. 507 articles were found, of which 43 were included. Indirect evidence suggests a role of vitamin D and fetal lung maturation. In relation to pediatric pulmonary pathology, studies are scarce and inconclusive. Recent meta-analyses performed with individualized evaluation of the participants shows an important protective role of vitamin D supplementation in the prevention of severe asthma exacerbations and acute viral infections. In bronchiolitis, the results are contradictory, with no clear relationship between plasma levels and severity. There is not enough evidence to assess the benefits of vitamin D supplementation in cystic fibrosis and tuberculosis. A direct relationship between the severity of sleep-related breathing disorders and vitamin D plasma levels has recently been proposed, although the exact mechanisms involved in this association are unknown. Current information suggests that vitamin D supplementation may represent a cost-effective strategy in redu cing important causes of infant morbidity and mortality.

Thiamine deficiency (vitamin B1) is common in patients with alcohol dependence. Cognitive impairments may be an early consequence of thiamine deficiency. Wernicke's encephalopathy is underdiagnosed and undertreated. In patients with established Wernicke's encephalopathy, parenteral thiamine 200-500mg three times a day should be given for 3-5 days, followed by oral thiamine 250-1000mg/day. In patients with suspected Wernicke's encephalopathy, parenteral thiamine 250-300mg should be given two times a day for 3-5 days, followed by oral thiamine 250-300mg/day. In patients at high risk of thiamine deficiency, parenteral thiamine 250-500mg/day should be given for 3-5 days, followed by oral thiamine 250-300mg/day. In patients at low risk (with uncomplicated alcohol dependence), oral thiamine 250-500mg/day should be given for 3-5 days, followed by oral thiamine 100-250mg/day.

To better understand the relation of sleep complaint to sleep continuity and periodic movements during sleep (PMS), two groups of patients were studied retrospectively. One group of 51 patients, 26 men and 25 women, with a mean age of 56.4 years, complained of insomnia. The other group of 29 patients, 20 men and nine women, with a mean age of 55.8 years, complained of excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleepy patients differed significantly from insomnia patients in that they fell asleep faster and slept longer. They showed more frequent arousals (shifts to stage 1 sleep and number of awakenings) than insomnia patients who had longer arousals (mean duration of awakenings). Insomnia patients had more series of PMS, but sleepy patients had more PMS bursts per series.

A large, representative sample of licensed dental hygienists practicing in the United States was surveyed by ADHA regarding dental hygiene demographics, office characteristics, supervision and practice behavior, infection control practices, utilization of medical and dental histories, and continuing education. This paper presents the continuing education portion of this survey and specifically explores relationships among descriptive variables such as dental hygienists' ages, types of practice, membership in ADHA, continuing education courses attended, and interest versus need in continuing education course attendance. Results indicate that continuing education participation is most likely for dental hygienists under 25 years of age and who are working over 30 hours per week in a speciality office which employs seven or more staff members. Comparisons among dentist, dental hygienist, and dental assistant participation were made for selected continuing education topics. According to the respondents, more dental hygienists than dentists or dental assistants have participated in continuing education courses on blood pressure measurement, aseptic technique, AIDs, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Dental hygienists perceived a need for attendance by all dental personnel in selected continuing education programs.

This study compared the prevalence of asthma in travelling schoolboys and settled controls to determine whether the travelling lifestyle may be a protective factor in the development of asthma. Information was collected by parental responses to the ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) questionnaire. The design was a cross-sectional study with descriptive and analytical components. The subjects were six to twelve year old schoolboys from all male travelling children in Cork and from a selection of settled schoolboys. In addition the study collected information on the predictor variables--age, passive smoking and number of siblings. The questionnaire was administered to 54 travelling boys and 129 controls. The parent reported prevalence of wheeze and related symptoms were all more common in controls compared with the travelling boys. The values were significant for wheeze in the last year (31.3% v 14.8%; OR-5.6, p = 0.025), and for doctor diagnosed asthma (25.6% v 11.1%; OR = 5.1, p = 0.04). Schoolboys from travelling families have less wheeze and doctor diagnosed asthma than controls. The experience of the travelling lifestyle maybe a protective factor in the development of asthma.

BMC complementary and alternative medicine	2016	train	5	7	7	Clarification of the molecular pathway of Taiwan local pomegranate fruit juice underlying the inhibition of urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma cell by proteomics strategy.  BACKGROUND: Pomegranate fruit has been shown to exhibit the inhibitory activity against prostate cancer and lung cancer in vitro and in vivo, which might be a resource for chemoprevention and chemotherapy of cancer. Our previous documented findings indicated that treatment of urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma cell with the ethanol extract isolated from the juice of pomegranate fruit grown in Taiwan could inhibit tumor cell. In this study we intended to uncover the molecular pathway underlying anti-cancer efficacy of Taiwan pomegranate fruit juice against urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma. METHODS: We exploited two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to find the de-regulated proteins. Western immunoblotting was used to confirm the results collected from proteomics study. RESULTS: Comparative proteomics indicated that 20 proteins were differentially expressed in ethanol extract-treated T24 cells with 19 up-regulated and 1 down-regulated proteins. These de-regulated proteins were involved in apoptosis, cytoskeleton regulation, cell proliferation, proteasome activity and aerobic glycolysis. Further studies on signaling pathway demonstrated that ethanol extract treatment might inhibit urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma cell proliferation through restriction of PTEN/AKT/mTORC1 pathway via profilin 1 up-regulation. It also might evoke cell apoptosis through Diablo over-expression. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide a global picture to further investigate the anticancer molecular mechanism of pomegranate fruit.

Clinical and experimental hypertension (New York, N.Y. : 1993)	2000	train	25	6	2	Mechanism of antihypertensive effect of dietary potassium in experimental volume expanded hypertension in rats.  Dietary potassium supplementation lowers blood pressure (BP) and attenuates complications in hypertensive subjects, particularly those with the low renin volume expanded (LRVE) variety. We and others have shown that the plasma level of a digitalis like substance (DLS) is elevated in this type of hypertension. We therefore, examined the effect of increases in dietary potassium on the plasma level of endogenous DLS, myocardial and renal Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA) activities, BP, and renal excretory function in reduced renal mass (RRM)-salt hypertension in the rat, a classical model of LRVE hypertension. 70% RRM rats were divided in 4 groups, namely those consuming: 1) a sodium free and normal potassium (1.3% as KCl) diet (RRM-0 Na), 2) a normal sodium and normal potassium diet (RRM-NaK), 3) a normal sodium and high potassium (2 X normal) diet (RRM-Na2K), and 4) a normal sodium and 4 times normal potassium diet (RRM-Na4K). At the end of 4 weeks of dietary treatment, direct BP was recorded, plasma level of DLS determined by bioassay and with a radioimmunoassay for digoxin (DIF) and myocardial and renal NKA activities were measured. As expected, compared to RRM-0Na rats, RRM-NaK rats developed hypertension. BP increased significantly less in RRM-Na2K, whereas BP did not increase in RRM-Na4K rats. Hypertension in RRM-NaK rats was associated with an increase in plasma DLS and DIF and decrease in renal and myocardial NKA activities. DLS was increased (DIF was not changed) and myocardial NKA also decreased in rats consuming double potassium. However, quadrupling potassium in the diet (RRM-Na4K) normalized DLS and DIF and increased myocardial and renal NKA activities, compared to RRM-0Na rats. Also compared to RRM-0Na, water consumption, urinary volume excretion, sodium, and potassium increased in the other 3 groups, more so in RRM-Na4K rats. These data show that quadrupling the potassium in the diet prevents the BP increase in RRM rats and this is associated with diuresis/natriuresis and normalization of DLS, perhaps because the diuresis/natriuresis normalizes blood volume.

Gastroenterology	2001	train	9	11	1	Treatment of vitamin D deficiency due to Crohn's disease with tanning bed ultraviolet B radiation.  In Crohn's disease, severe skeletal demineralization, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and muscle weakness can occur. This may be caused by impaired vitamin D absorption, resulting from extensive intestinal disease and resection of duodenum and jejunum, where vitamin D is absorbed. We report a 57-year-old woman with a long history of Crohn's disease and short-bowel syndrome who had only 2 feet of small intestine remaining after 3 bowel resections. She was taking a daily multivitamin containing 400 IU of vitamin D(3) and was dependent on total parenteral nutrition that contained 200 IU of vitamin D and calcium (18 mEq in a 1-L bag infused over 8 hours daily) for a period of 36 months. Despite the above replacement, she complained of bone pain and muscle weakness, and she continued to be vitamin D-deficient with a 25(OH)D level <20 ng/mL. She was then exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation in a tanning bed wearing a 1-piece bathing suit for 10 minutes, 3 times a week for 6 months at the General Clinical Research Center, Boston University Medical Center. She tolerated the irradiation well without evidence of erythema. After 4 weeks, her serum 25(OH)D level increased by 357% from 7 to 32 ng/mL, parathyroid hormone level decreased by 52% from 92 to 44 pg/mL, and the serum calcium level increased from 7.8 to 8.5 mg/dL. After 6 months of UVB treatment, her serum 25(OH)D level was maintained in the normal range and was free of muscle weakness, and bone and muscle pain.  
33321949	Toward COVID-19 Information: Infodemic or Fear of Missing Out?	Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)	2020	train	7	5	0	Toward COVID-19 Information: Infodemic or Fear of Missing Out?  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic and exerted a profound physiological and mental impact on the public. Due to anxiety from being bombarded by information from the news and social media, people may constantly read and repost, with a fear of missing out (FOMO), information about COVID-19 on social media. So far, there has been little research on COVID-19 FOMO. We therefore compiled the COVID-19 information fear of missing out scale (CIFS) and administered it to 1178 adults in Taiwan to identify the possible factors influencing CIFS scores. We demonstrated that the CIFS had good reliability, factor validity, and criterion validity. With regard to demographic variables, we found that gender, marital status, travel time to the nearest hospital, and educational background influenced CIFS scores. In contrast, the participant age and whether he or she lived in an urban area did not affect the CIFS scores. With regard to social media usage, social media usage time (r = 0.025) and the numbers of COVID-19-related posts read on social media (r = 0.117) or instant messaging (r = 0.169) were not highly correlated with CIFS scores. Rather, CIFS scores were found to be significantly correlated to the frequency of reposting COVID-19-related information on social media (r = 0.497) and on instant messaging (r = 0.447). These results indicate that CIFS scores are closely associated not with passive browsing on social media but with the frequency at which an individual actively reposts information. In other words, what creates CIF is not an overabundance of information (i.e., an infodemic) but the active reposting and interpretation of information. Individual autonomy for interpretation of the received information and self-determination about reposting are key factors for COVID-19 information FOMO. When facing the COVID-19-related news on social media, it is the active information-related FOMO, not the passive infodemic, that influences our social media usage.  
28211964	Relationship between pathological gambling, alexithymia, and gambling type.	The American journal on addictions	2017	dev	15	11	1	"Relationship between pathological gambling, alexithymia, and gambling type.  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to see if: (i) alexithymia is associated with PG and with the severity of gambling behavior; (ii) alexithymia is associated with strategic and non-strategic gambling. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-six gamblers were recruited in different gambling locations. First, pathological gamblers (PGs) (n = 106) were compared to non-pathological gamblers (NPGs) (n = 120). Second, strategic gamblers (n = 92) were compared to non-strategic gamblers (n = 96). RESULTS: After controlling for being or not depressed, PGs have significantly higher alexithymia scores. Alexithymia is positively correlated to the intensity of gambling behavior and associated with PG: being alexithymic (OR = 4.21, SEB = .32, p < .001), ""difficulty identifying feelings"" (OR = 1.07, SEB = .03, p = .038), and ""externally-oriented thinking"" (OR = 1.07, SEB = .03, p = .026) factors. Nevertheless, while alexithymia is associated with PG in strategic gamblers (being alexithymic (OR = 6.80, SEB = .50 p < .001) and ""difficulty identifying feelings"" (OR = 1.12, SEB = .05 p = .026) factor), this is not the case in non-strategic gamblers. In the latter, only depression is associated with PG (OR = 3.43, SEB = .50 p = .013). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The results highlight the importance of taking into account the gambling type in the relationship between alexithymia, depression, and PG. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: In non-strategic PGs, specific therapies targeting depression could be appropriate, while for strategic PGs, specific psychotherapeutic techniques like body-centered psychotherapy could help them to differentiate feelings from bodily sensations.

34436592	Association of Mixed Use of Electronic and Conventional Cigarettes and Exposure to Secondhand Smoke With Prediabetes.	The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism	2022	dev	23	12	7	Association of mixed use of electronic and conventional cigarettes and exposure to second-hand smoke with prediabetes.  CONTEXT: Despite previous studies regarding the association between smoking and diabetes, the effects of electronic cigarettes and second-hand smoke (SHS) on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity have not been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of mixed electronic and conventional cigarette use and exposure to SHS with prediabetes. DESIGN: Data from the 2014-2018 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed. SETTING: Nationwide population-based. PARTICIPANTS: Of 39,199 participants, 22,385 participants (9,490 men, 12,895 women) without diabetes were included. The main independent variables were smoking behaviors, including exposure to SHS. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Prediabetes (HbA1C of 5.7-6.4%). RESULTS: Of 22,385 participants without diabetes, 6,735 had prediabetes. Mixed cigarette use was associated with a 1.57-fold increase in the odds of prediabetes when compared with never-smoking (odds ratio [OR]=1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.29-1.92) and a 1.27-fold increase when compared with conventional cigarette use only (OR=1.27, 95% CI=1.07-1.52). Participants who were current non-smokers but mixed users in the past had an increased risk of prediabetes (OR=1.54, 95% CI=1.04-2.13). There was no significant association between prediabetes and current non-smoking in individuals with previous conventional cigarette use only. Among never-smokers, exposure to SHS significantly increased the risk of prediabetes (OR=1.16, 95% CI=1.04-1.30). CONCLUSIONS: Mixed use of electronic and conventional cigarettes and exposure to SHS increased the risk of prediabetes. Further studies are required to comprehensively investigate the molecular biology underlying the effects of previous and current mixed use of electronic cigarettes and SHS on glucose metabolism.  
33997969	COVID-19 Knowledge and Behavior Change among High School Students in Semi-Rural Georgia.	The Journal of school health	2021	dev	13	3	1	COVID-19 Knowledge and Behavior Change among High School Students in Semi-Rural Georgia.  BACKGROUND: Many schools transitioned online to reduce viral spread and promote social distancing amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Remote learning may impact health behaviors and coping strategies among adolescents, including reduced physical activity and increased screen time. Social media and peers provide information about the pandemic to adolescents and may influence prevention behaviors. This study aims to assess adolescent knowledge and information about COVID-19, determine students' behavior change, and identify sources students turn to for information on the pandemic. METHODS: Students from 2 high schools in semi-rural Georgia participated in a cross-sectional online survey in March 2020 (N = 761). RESULTS: Common sources for COVID-19 news were peers (80%) and social media (58%). Few adolescents (3%) indicated that teenagers were at higher risk of severe illness due to COVID-19. Responses reveal adolescents understand social distancing and many are participating in prevention behaviors, including handwashing (87%) and staying at home as much as possible (87%). Most respondents reported increases in screen time outside of class (82%). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest adolescents are obtaining COVID-19 knowledge from various sources, including social media, with varying degrees of implementation of prevention practices. Increases in screen time and reduced physical activity may impact long-term health among adolescents.  
17381860	Efficacy of curcumin therapy against Angiostrongylus cantonensis-induced eosinophilic meningitis.	Journal of helminthology	2007	dev	5	7	1	Efficacy of curcumin therapy against Angiostrongylus cantonensis-induced eosinophilic meningitis.  Angiostrongylus cantonensis can invade the central nervous system, leading to human eosinophilic meningitis or eosinophilic meningoencephalitis. Curcumin is a natural product which has the effects of anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and anti-carcinogensis, while the administration of curcumin has been reported to possibly relieve the symptoms of meningitis. The present study tested the potential efficacy of curcumin in A. cantonensis-induced eosinophilic meningitis of BALB/c mice. Assay indicators for the therapeutic effect included the larvicidal effect, eosinophil counts and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity in angiostrongyliasis. Eosinophils were mildly reduced in treatment groups compared with infected-untreated mice. However, there were no significant differences in larvicidal effects or MMP-9 activity. This study suggests that anti-inflammatory treatment with curcumin alone has low efficacy, but the treatment does not interfere with MMP-9 expression and is not useful for larvicidal effects. The possible reasons include low curcumin across the blood-brain barrier and also those larvae that survive stimulate MMP-9 production, which promotes blood-brain barrier damage, with leukocytes then crossing the blood-brain barrier to cause meningitis. Further studies will be required to test these possibilities.  
23040955	[Cannabis: Use and dependence].	Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)	2012	dev	10	16	8	[Cannabis: Use and dependence].  The main characteristics of cannabis dependence are craving, persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control cannabis use and important social, occupational, or recreational activities given up or reduced because of cannabis use. Withdrawal symptoms include insomnia, irritability, anger, restlessness, depression, mood swings and cravings. Regular cannabis use induces cognitive impairment, especially of attention, episodic memory and working memory. Alcohol and other substances abuse or dependence are frequently found in patients with cannabis dependence. Psychiatric comorbidities are frequent in patients with cannabis dependence, in particular anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and personality disorders. The treatment of cannabis dependence includes behavioral psychotherapy, especially motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral therapy, alongside treatment of co-occurring mental health and substance use conditions. There are currently no available pharmacological treatment interventions for cannabis dependence. The treatment of cannabis dependence and withdrawal remains nonspecific.  
32635422	Provision of Psychotherapy during the COVID-19 Pandemic among Czech, German and Slovak Psychotherapists.	International journal of environmental research and public health	2020	dev	8	12	0	Provision of Psychotherapy during the COVID-19 Pandemic among Czech, German and Slovak Psychotherapists.  Psychotherapists around the world are facing an unprecedented situation with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To combat the rapid spread of the virus, direct contact with others has to be avoided when possible. Therefore, remote psychotherapy provides a valuable option to continue mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study investigated the fear of psychotherapists to become infected with COVID-19 during psychotherapy in personal contact and assessed how the provision of psychotherapy changed due to the COVID-19 situation and whether there were differences with regard to country and gender. Psychotherapists from three European countries: Czech Republic (CZ, n = 112), Germany (DE, n = 130) and Slovakia (SK, n = 96), with on average 77.8% female participants, completed an online survey. Participants rated the fear of COVID-19 infection during face-to-face psychotherapy and reported the number of patients treated on average per week (in personal contact, via telephone, via internet) during the COVID-19 situation as well as (retrospectively) in the months before. Fear of COVID-19 infection was highest in SK and lowest in DE (p < 0.001) and was higher in female compared to male psychotherapists (p = 0.021). In all countries, the number of patients treated on average per week in personal contact decreased (p < 0.001) and remote psychotherapies increased (p < 0.001), with more patients being treated via internet than via telephone during the COVID-19 situation (p < 0.001). Furthermore, female psychotherapists treated less patients in personal contact (p = 0.036), while they treated more patients via telephone than their male colleagues (p = 0.015). Overall, the total number of patients treated did not differ during COVID-19 from the months before (p = 0.133) and psychotherapy in personal contact remained the most common treatment modality. Results imply that the supply of mental health care could be maintained during COVID-19 and that changes in the provision of psychotherapy vary among countries and gender.  
23306210	Effect of diet on serotonergic neurotransmission in depression.	Neurochemistry international	2013	dev	21	18	4	Effect of diet on serotonergic neurotransmission in depression.  Depression is characterized by sadness, purposelessness, irritability, and impaired body functions. Depression causes severe symptoms for several weeks, and dysthymia, which may cause chronic, low-grade symptoms. Treatment of depression involves psychotherapy, medications, or phototherapy. Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that an appropriate diet can reduce symptoms of depression. The neurotransmitter, serotonin (5-HT), synthesized in the brain, plays an important role in mood alleviation, satiety, and sleep regulation. Although certain fruits and vegetables are rich in 5-HT, it is not easily accessible to the CNS due to blood brain barrier. However the serotonin precursor, tryptophan, can readily pass through the blood brain barrier. Tryptophan is converted to 5-HT by tryptophan hydroxylase and 5-HTP decarboxylase, respectively, in the presence of pyridoxal phosphate, derived from vitamin B(6). Hence diets poor in tryptophan may induce depression as this essential amino acid is not naturally abundant even in protein-rich foods. Tryptophan-rich diet is important in patients susceptible to depression such as certain females during pre and postmenstrual phase, post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic pain, cancer, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. Carbohydrate-rich diet triggers insulin response to enhance the bioavailability of tryptophan in the CNS which is responsible for increased craving of carbohydrate diets. Although serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are prescribed to obese patients with depressive symptoms, these agents are incapable of precisely regulating the CNS serotonin and may cause life-threatening adverse effects in the presence of monoamine oxidase inhibitors. However, CNS serotonin synthesis can be controlled by proper intake of tryptophan-rich diet. This report highlights the clinical significance of tryptophan-rich diet and vitamin B(6) to boost serotonergic neurotransmission in depression observed in various neurodegenerative diseases. However pharmacological interventions to modulate serotonergic neurotransmission in depression, remains clinically significant. Depression may involve several other molecular mechanisms as discussed briefly in this report.  
11850554	Nested case-control study of lung cancer in four Chinese tin mines.	Occupational and environmental medicine	2002	dev	32	12	9	Nested case-control study of lung cancer in four Chinese tin mines.  OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relation between occupational dust exposure and lung cancer in tin mines. This is an update of a previous study of miners with high exposure to dust at four tin mines in southern China. METHODS: A nested case-control study of 130 male lung cancer cases and 627 controls was initiated from a cohort study of 7855 subjects employed at least 1 year between 1972 and 1974 in four tin mines in China. Three of the tin mines were in Dachang and one was in Limu. Cumulative total exposure to dust and cumulative exposure to arsenic were calculated for each person based on industrial hygiene records. Measurements of arsenic, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and radon in the work sites were also evaluated. Odds ratios (ORs), standard statistic analysis and logistic regression were used for analyses. RESULTS: Increased risk of lung cancer was related to cumulative exposure to dust, duration of exposure, cumulative exposure to arsenic, and tobacco smoking. The risk ratios for low, medium, and high cumulative exposure to dust were 2.1 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.1 to 3.8), 1.7 (95% CI 0.9 to 3.1), and 2.8 (95% CI 1.6 to 5.0) respectively after adjustment for smoking. The risk for lung cancer among workers with short, medium, and long exposure to dust were 1.9 (95% CI 1.0 to 3.5), 2.3 (95% CI 1.3 to 4.1), and 2.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 4.2) respectively after adjusting for smoking. Several sets of risk factors for lung cancer were compared, and the best predictive model included tobacco smoking (OR=1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.4) and cumulative exposure to arsenic (ORs for different groups from low to high exposure were 2.1 (95% CI 1.1 to 3.9); 2.1 (95% CI 1.1 to 3.9); 1.8 (95% CI 1.0 to 3.6); and 3.6 (95% CI 1.8 5 to 7.3)). No excess of lung cancer was found among silicotic subjects in the Limu tin mine although there was a high prevalence of silicosis. Exposures to radon were low in the four tin mines and no carcinogenic PAHs were detected. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide little support for the hypothesis that respirable crystalline silica induces lung cancer. Ore dust in work sites acts as a carrier, the exposure to arsenic and tobacco smoking play a more important part in carcinogenesis of lung cancer in tin miners. Silicosis seems not to be related to the increased risk of lung cancer.  
28370427	Ventilation rates in recently constructed U.S. school classrooms.	Indoor air	2017	dev	17	0	0	Ventilation rates in recently constructed U.S. school classrooms.  Low ventilation rates (VRs) in schools have been associated with absenteeism, poorer academic performance, and teacher dissatisfaction. We measured VRs in 37 recently constructed or renovated and mechanically ventilated U.S. schools, including LEED and EnergyStar-certified buildings, using CO2 and the steady-state, build-up, decay, and transient mass balance methods. The transient mass balance method better matched conditions (specifically, changes in occupancy) and minimized biases seen in the other methods. During the school day, air change rates (ACRs) averaged 2.0+/-1.3 hour(-1) , and only 22% of classrooms met recommended minimum ventilation rates. HVAC systems were shut off at the school day close, and ACRs dropped to 0.21+/-0.19 hour(-1) . VRs did not differ by building type, although cost-cutting and comfort measures resulted in low VRs and potentially impaired IAQ. VRs were lower in schools that used unit ventilators or radiant heating, in smaller schools and in larger classrooms. The steady-state, build-up, and decay methods had significant limitations and biases, showing the need to confirm that these methods are appropriate. Findings highlight the need to increase VRs and to ensure that energy saving and comfort measures do not compromise ventilation and IAQ.  
24757636	Gender differences in coronary artery disease: correlational study on dietary pattern and known cardiovascular risk factors.	International cardiovascular research journal	2013	dev	23	14	4	Gender differences in coronary artery disease: correlational study on dietary pattern and known cardiovascular risk factors.  BACKGROUND: The relationship between diet and cardiovascular risk factors in men and women with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) has been the subject of recent studies. We studied a group of Iranian CAD patients to analyze any relationship between diet and CAD risk factors based on gender. METHODS: In this study, 461 consecutive patients were assessed before their planned isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery. They were interviewed to obtain the quantity and components of nutrients and micronutrients based on a validated food frequency questionnaire. Diet scores were calculated in each dietary group and the total score was reported as the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index (Med-DQI). Physical activity was assessed using International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Functional class, EuroSCORE and the frequency of the known risk factors in the men and women were recorded as well. RESULTS: The women were more likely than the men to present with obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension (all Ps < 0.001). Also, the women had higher functional class and mean of EuroSCORE (P < 0.001 and P = 0.03). Only six women (5.7%) reported to have regular physical activity. In addition, Women's energy intake was more likely to be supplied through fat. Cereals, fruit, and vegetable consumption in both genders was within the safe recommended range, while olive and fish consumption was low in both sexes. MedDQI score was different between men and women with hypertension (P = 0.018) and obesity (P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Modifiable classical risk factors for CAD, except for smoking, were more prevalent in women and were associated with their diet. Therefore, women probably need to maintain low calorie intake while improving physical activity and dietary patterns to decrease the frequency and severity of modifiable cardiac risk factors.  
32135452	Sleep in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of polysomnographic findings.	Sleep medicine reviews	2020	dev	13	11	7	Sleep in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of polysomnographic findings.  Polysomnographic studies have been conducted to explore sleep changes in Parkinson's disease (PD), but the relationships between sleep disturbances and PD are imperfectly understood. We conducted a systematic review of the literature exploring polysomnographic differences between PD patients and controls in EMBASE, MEDLINE, All EBM databases, CINAHL, and PsycIFNO. 67 studies were identified for systematic review, 63 of which were used for meta-analysis. Meta-analyses revealed significant reductions in total sleep time, sleep efficiency, N2 percentage, slow wave sleep, rapid eye movement sleep (REM) percentage, and increases in wake time after sleep onset, N1 percentage, REM latency, apnea hypopnea index, and periodic limb movement index in PD patients compared with controls. There were no remarkable differences in sleep continuity or sleep architecture between PD patients with and without REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Our study suggests that PD patients have poor sleep quality and quantity. Sex, age, disease duration, presence of RBD, medication status, cognitive impairment, and adaptation night are factors that contributed to heterogeneity between studies.  
15101859	The analgesic effect of morphine on postoperative pain in diabetic patients.	Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica	2004	dev	5	5	0	The analgesic effect of morphine on postoperative pain in diabetic patients.  BACKGROUND: Many clinical and experimental studies have suggested that diabetes or hyperglycemia alter opioid responsiveness. However, little information is available on the effects of diabetes mellitus on opioid requirements in the postoperative period. METHODS: Sixty-four patients scheduled for elective, total abdominal hysterectomy were included into this prospective study to evaluate the effect of diabetes mellitus on morphine requirement in the postoperative period. A loading dose of morphine (50 micro g kg(-1)) was administered in the perioperative period. Postoperative analgesia consisted of intravenous morphine-PCA. No analgesic other than morphine was allowed during the study. In cases of inadequate analgesia intravenous 1 mg of morphine was given as a rescue analgesic. Cumulative morphine consumption, pain scores and morphine-related adverse effects were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were evaluated: Group D, 30; and Group ND, 30. Patients in Group D received more morphine than those in Group ND (54.12 +/- 25.09 and 42.66 +/- 20.67, respectively). The difference in cumulative morphine consumption was higher in the first hour (P = 0.037) in diabetic patients and they required significantly more morphine in the last 24 h (P = 0.015). Postoperative pain scores were higher in the diabetic group. More patients in the diabetic group required rescue medication (26 vs. 19) and felt nauseous (25 vs. 14; P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The findings of the study appear to support experimental and clinical impressions that the analgesic effect of morphine is attenuated in hyperglycemic conditions. Therefore, larger doses of morphine may be administered to diabetic patients for effective postoperative analgesia.  
30444557	Locals get travellers' diarrhoea too: risk factors for diarrhoeal illness and pathogenic Escherichia coli infection across an urban-rural gradient in Ecuador.	Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH	2019	dev	19	13	1	Locals get travellers' diarrhoea too: risk factors for diarrhoeal illness and pathogenic Escherichia coli infection across an urban-rural gradient in Ecuador.  OBJECTIVES: Diarrhoea is a common and well-studied cause of illness afflicting international travellers. However, traveller's diarrhoea can also result from travel between high and low disease transmission regions within a country, which is the focus of this study. METHODS: We recruited participants for a case-control study of diarrhoea at four sites along an urban-rural gradient in Northern Ecuador: Quito, Esmeraldas, Borbon and rural communities outside of Borbon. At each of these sites, approximately 100 subjects with diarrhoea (cases) were recruited from Ministry of Health clinics and were age-matched with subjects visiting the same clinics for other complaints (controls). RESULTS: Travellers to urban destinations had higher risk of diarrhoea and diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) infections. Travel to Quito was associated with diarrhoea (aOR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.10-3.68) and travel to Guayaquil (another urban centre in Ecuador) was associated with Diffuse Adherent E. coli infection (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.01-4.33). Compared to those not travelling, urban origins were also associated with greater risk of diarrhoea in Esmeraldas (aOR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.20-4.41), and with higher risk of diarrhoeagenic E. coli infections in Quito (aOR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.16-5.86), with >50% of travel from Quito and Esmeraldas specified to another urban destination. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that individuals travelling from lower-transmission regions (rural areas) to higher transmission regions (urban centres) within a single country are at a greater risk of acquiring a diarrhoea-related illness. Investments to improve water, sanitation and hygiene conditions in urban areas could have impacts on outlying rural areas within a given country.  
32955899	The importance of coenzyme Q10 and its ratio to cholesterol in the progress of chronic kidney diseases linked to non- -communicable diseases.	Bratislavske lekarske listy	2020	dev	4	22	0	The importance of coenzyme Q10 and its ratio to cholesterol in the progress of chronic kidney diseases linked to non- -communicable diseases.  OBJECTIVES: The mortality of patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD) increases with the decrease in glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In the progress of CKD that is closely linked to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), the role of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is not fully evaluated. We aimed to evaluate the importance of CoQ10, CoQ10/cholesterol ratio, and oxidative stress in the progress of CKD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The control group was constituted of 19 healthy subjects who volunteered to enrol in the study, CKD group consisted of 58 patients with CKD, of whom 54 had CKD combined with hypertension, 22 had CKD combined with hypertension and diabetes type 2 , and 18 had CKD combined with hypertension and statin therapy. We observed age, BMI, creatinine, uric acid, eGFR, hemoglobin, CRP, glucose, lipids fraction, and liver enzymes. Coenzyme Q10-TOTAL (ubiquinol+ubiquinone) in platelets and plasma were determined using HPLC method with UV detection. Indexed of CoQ10/lipid fractions were evaluated. Oxidative stress was determined as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). RESULTS: With increased stages of CKD, eGFR and CoQ10 as well as its ratio to lipids were significantly reduced while TBARS increased. CONCLUSION: We assume that lower endogenous CoQ10 level may be one of the reasons of kidney dysfunction. CoQ10/lipids ratio and increase in oxidative stress can predict the progression of CKD in patients with arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia (Tab. 2, Fig. 4, Ref. 49).  
30032352	Responsible Gambling Research and Industry Funding Biases.	Journal of gambling studies	2019	dev	5	0	0	Responsible Gambling Research and Industry Funding Biases.  This brief report examines whether there are differences in aspects of different characteristics, including design/methodologies of responsible gambling (RG), between studies funded by industry as compared to other sources. To investigate this, the authors used those studies included in a recent meta-analysis focusing on the empirical basis of RG initiatives (Ladouceur et al. in Addict Res Theory 25:225-235, 2017). We examined eight associations between funding sources, and different design/methodological characteristics of these studies; type of strategy, inclusion of comparison groups, measurement scales and repeated measures, publication source, number of inclusion criteria met, secondary sources of funding, publication year. The results revealed no statistically significant difference between the funding source, and the index study characteristics. These results do not support claims that funding exerts influence on the design or methodologies of RG studies. However, the absence of statistically significant findings should not be used to assert the absence of a funding effect because there are many reasons for failing to find differences, or interpretation of findings. Unexpectedly, a third of the papers included in this study failed to disclose their funding sources. This finding highlights the need for more open and transparent disclosures.  
28513054	Is there a common motor dysregulation in sleepwalking and REM sleep behaviour disorder?	Journal of sleep research	2017	dev	6	33	0	Is there a common motor dysregulation in sleepwalking and REM sleep behaviour disorder?  This study sought to determine if there is any overlap between the two major non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement parasomnias, i.e. sleepwalking/sleep terrors and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. We assessed adult patients with sleepwalking/sleep terrors using rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder screening questionnaires and determined if they had enhanced muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep. Conversely, we assessed rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder patients using the Paris Arousal Disorders Severity Scale and determined if they had more N3 awakenings. The 251 participants included 64 patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (29 with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and 35 with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder associated with Parkinson's disease), 62 patients with sleepwalking/sleep terrors, 66 old healthy controls (age-matched with the rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder group) and 59 young healthy controls (age-matched with the sleepwalking/sleep terrors group). They completed the rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder screening questionnaire, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder single question and Paris Arousal Disorders Severity Scale. In addition, all the participants underwent a video-polysomnography. The sleepwalking/sleep terrors patients scored positive on rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder scales and had a higher percentage of 'any' phasic rapid eye movement sleep without atonia when compared with controls; however, these patients did not have higher tonic rapid eye movement sleep without atonia or complex behaviours during rapid eye movement sleep. Patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder had moderately elevated scores on the Paris Arousal Disorders Severity Scale but did not exhibit more N3 arousals (suggestive of non-rapid eye movement parasomnia) than the control group. These results indicate that dream-enacting behaviours (assessed by rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder screening questionnaires) are commonly reported by sleepwalking/sleep terrors patients, thus decreasing the questionnaire's specificity. Furthermore, sleepwalking/sleep terrors patients have excessive twitching during rapid eye movement sleep, which may result either from a higher dreaming activity in rapid eye movement sleep or from a more generalised non-rapid eye movement/rapid eye movement motor dyscontrol during sleep.  
23682322	The role of vitamin C in prevention of preterm premature rupture of membranes.	Iranian Red Crescent medical journal	2013	dev	6	12	2	The role of vitamin C in prevention of preterm premature rupture of membranes.  BACKGROUND: Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is one of the most important complications of the pregnancy and cause perinatal morbidity and mortality. History of PPROM is a risk factor of recurrent PPROM. Vitamin C plays an important role in collagen metabolism and increases resistance maintenance of the chorioamniotic membranes. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of vitamin C supplementation in prevention of PPROM in women with a positive history of PPROM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This clinical trial study was performed on 170 pregnant women with the history of PPROM, with singleton pregnancy and gestational age 14 weeks in Imam-Reza Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences during 2008 to 2010. They were randomly divided into two groups. The case patients received 100 mg vitamin C daily from 14th weeks of gestation. PPROM occurrence was compared between two groups as an indicator of the protective effect of vitamin C supplements. RESULTS: PPROM occurred in 44.7% of controls and 31.8% of cases (P &lt; 0.05). PROM occurred in 34.1% of controls and 18.8% of cases (P &lt; 0.05). Pregnancy was terminated at term gestation in 21.2% of controls and 49.4% of cases (P &lt; 0.05). Rupture of membranes was significantly decreased in the case group. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin C supplementations after 14th weeks of gestation can prevent from PPROM in women with the history of PPROM.

Annals of internal medicine	1988	dev	1	6	0	Glyburide or insulin for metabolic control in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. A randomized, double-blind study.  STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative efficacy, risks, and benefits of insulin with glyburide in achieving normoglycemia in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a 9-month treatment period. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: Thirty-one patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who did not have normal glucose control with diet alone. INTERVENTIONS: Once-per-day NPH insulin and placebo glyburide, or glyburide and once-per-day placebo insulin injection. Active drug and placebo adjusted in parallel to achieve fasting plasma glucose level less than 6.4 mmol/L (115 mg/dL) without hypoglycemia. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Insulin and glyburide produced similar improvement in fasting blood glucose levels and hemoglobin A1c concentrations, similar frequencies of mild symptomatic hypoglycemia, and similar weight gain despite dietary reinforcement. Triglyceride and cholesterol levels decreased and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and ratios of high-density lipoprotein to total cholesterol increased in both groups, with a significantly greater improvement in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and ratio of high-density lipoprotein total cholesterol in patients treated with insulin. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with glyburide or once-per-day NPH insulin provides a similar degree of glucose control in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Insulin may have a relative advantage in that it is associated with higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a higher ratio of high-density lipoprotein to total cholesterol.  
18820347	Does physical activity affect the predictive value of health-related fitness tests on walking difficulty?	Journal of physical activity & health	2008	dev	13	0	0	Does physical activity affect the predictive value of health-related fitness tests on walking difficulty?  BACKGROUND: Low levels of physical activity (PA) and poor fitness tend to predict a decline in mobility. The current study investigated whether PA modifies the predictive value of health-related fitness (HRF) tests on difficulty in walking 2 km (WD). METHODS: PA was assessed by self-reported questionnaires in 1990 and 1996. Subjects age 55 to 69 years and free of self-reported WD participated in assessment of HRF in 1996. Occurrence of WD was assessed by questionnaire in 2002 (n=537). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant interactions between PA and HRF tests; thus, PA and HRF were both independent predictors of WD. Regardless of the PA level, the subjects in the poorest performing third in each HRF test had higher risk of WD than the subjects in the best performing third. CONCLUSIONS: PA and HRF seemed to be independent predictors of WD, although the association of PA with WD was weaker than the association of HRF. Thus, PA did not modify the predictive value of HRF on WD.  
34294026	Mild traumatic brain injury affects the features of migraine.	The journal of headache and pain	2021	dev	9	14	0	Mild traumatic brain injury affects the features of migraine.  BACKGROUND: Headache is one of the most common symptoms after concussion, and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a risk factor for chronic migraine (CM). However, there remains a paucity of data regarding the impact of mTBI on migraine-related symptoms and clinical course. METHODS: Of 2161 migraine patients who participated in the American Registry for Migraine Research between February 2016 and March 2020, 1098 completed questions assessing history of TBI (50.8%). Forty-four patients reported a history of moderate to severe TBI, 413 patients reported a history of mTBI. Patients' demographics, headache symptoms and triggers, history of physical abuse, allodynia symptoms (ASC-12), migraine disability (MIDAS), depression (PHQ-2), and anxiety (GAD-7) were compared between migraine groups with (n = 413) and without (n = 641) a history of mTBI. Either the chi-square-test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate, was used for the analyses of categorical variables. The Mann-Whitney test was used for the analyses of continuous variables. Logistic regression models were used to compare variables of interest while adjusting for age, gender, and CM. RESULTS: A significantly higher proportion of patients with mTBI had CM (74.3% [307/413] vs. 65.8% [422/641], P = 0.004), had never been married or were divorced (36.6% [147/402] vs. 29.4% [187/636], P = 0.007), self-reported a history of physical abuse (24.3% [84/345] vs. 14.3% [70/491], P <  0.001), had mild to severe anxiety (50.5% [205/406] vs. 41.0% [258/630], P = 0.003), had headache-related vertigo (23.0% [95/413] vs. 15.9% [102/640], P = 0.009), and difficulty finding words (43.0% [174/405] vs. 32.9% [208/633], P <  0.001) in more than half their attacks, and headaches triggered by lack of sleep (39.4% [155/393] vs. 32.6% [198/607], P = 0.018) and reading (6.6% [26/393] vs. 3.0% [18/607], P = 0.016), compared to patients without mTBI. Patients with mTBI had significantly greater ASC-12 scores (median [interquartile range]; 5 [1-9] vs. 4 [1-7], P < 0.001), MIDAS scores (42 [18-85] vs. 34.5 [15-72], P = 0.034), and PHQ-2 scores (1 [0-2] vs. 1 [0-2], P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Patients with a history of mTBI are more likely to have a self-reported a history of physical abuse, vertigo, and allodynia during headache attacks, headaches triggered by lack of sleep and reading, greater headache burden and headache disability, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. This study suggests that a history of mTBI is associated with the phenotype, burden, clinical course, and associated comorbid diseases in patients with migraine, and highlights the importance of inquiring about a lifetime history of mTBI in patients being evaluated for migraine.  
17337645	Benzene exposure and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.	Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology	2007	dev	9	16	7	Benzene exposure and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  Exposure to benzene, an important industrial chemical and component of gasoline, is a widely recognized cause of leukemia, but its association with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is less clear. To clarify this issue, we undertook a systematic review of all case-control and cohort studies that identified probable occupational exposures to benzene and NHL morbidity or mortality. We identified 43 case-control studies of NHL outcomes that recognized persons with probable occupational exposure to benzene. Forty of these 43 (93%) studies show some elevation of NHL risk, with 23 of 43 (53%) studies finding statistically significant associations between NHL risk and probable benzene exposure. We also identified 26 studies of petroleum refinery workers reporting morbidity or mortality for lymphomas and all neoplasms and found that in 23 (88%), the rate of lymphoma morbidity or mortality was higher than that for all neoplasms. A substantial healthy-worker effect was evident in many of the studies and a comprehensive reevaluation of these studies with appropriate adjustments should be undertaken. Numerous studies have also reported associations between benzene exposure and the induction of lymphomas in mice. Further, because benzene is similar to alkylating drugs and radiation in producing leukemia, it is plausible that it might also produce lymphoma as they do and by similar mechanisms. Potential mechanisms include immunotoxicity and the induction of double-strand breaks with subsequent chromosome damage resulting in translocations and deletions. We conclude that, overall, the evidence supports an association between occupational benzene exposure and NHL.  
28266120	Prevention and control of dental caries and periodontal diseases at individual and population level: consensus report of group 3 of joint EFP/ORCA workshop on the boundaries between caries and periodontal diseases.	Journal of clinical periodontology	2017	dev	13	32	18	Prevention and control of dental caries and periodontal diseases at individual and population level: consensus report of group 3 of joint EFP/ORCA workshop on the boundaries between caries and periodontal diseases.  BACKGROUND: The non-communicable diseases dental caries and periodontal diseases pose an enormous burden on mankind. The dental biofilm is a major biological determinant common to the development of both diseases, and they share common risk factors and social determinants, important for their prevention and control. The remit of this working group was to review the current state of knowledge on epidemiology, socio-behavioural aspects as well as plaque control with regard to dental caries and periodontal diseases. METHODS: Discussions were informed by three systematic reviews on (i) the global burden of dental caries and periodontitis; (ii) socio-behavioural aspects in the prevention and control of dental caries and periodontal diseases at an individual and population level; and (iii) mechanical and chemical plaque control in the simultaneous management of gingivitis and dental caries. This consensus report is based on the outcomes of these systematic reviews and on expert opinion of the participants. RESULTS: Key findings included the following: (i) prevalence and experience of dental caries has decreased in many regions in all age groups over the last three decades; however, not all societal groups have benefitted equally from this decline; (ii) although some studies have indicated a possible decline in periodontitis prevalence, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that prevalence has changed over recent decades; (iii) because of global population growth and increased tooth retention, the number of people affected by dental caries and periodontitis has grown substantially, increasing the total burden of these diseases globally (by 37% for untreated caries and by 67% for severe periodontitis) as estimated between 1990 and 2013, with high global economic impact; (iv) there is robust evidence for an association of low socio-economic status with a higher risk of having dental caries/caries experience and also with higher prevalence of periodontitis; (v) the most important behavioural factor, affecting both dental caries and periodontal diseases, is routinely performed oral hygiene with fluoride; (vi) population-based interventions address behavioural factors to control dental caries and periodontitis through legislation (antismoking, reduced sugar content in foods and drinks), restrictions (taxes on sugar and tobacco) guidelines and campaigns; however, their efficacy remains to be evaluated; (vii) psychological approaches aimed at changing behaviour may improve the effectiveness of oral health education; (viii) different preventive strategies have proven to be effective during the course of life; (ix) management of both dental caries and gingivitis relies heavily on efficient self-performed oral hygiene, that is toothbrushing with a fluoride-containing toothpaste and interdental cleaning; (x) professional tooth cleaning, oral hygiene instruction and motivation, dietary advice and fluoride application are effective in managing dental caries and gingivitis. CONCLUSION: The prevention and control of dental caries and periodontal diseases and the prevention of ultimate tooth loss is a lifelong commitment employing population- and individual-based interventions.  
22570973	Hepatic dysfunction is associated with vitamin D deficiency and poor glycemic control in diabetes mellitus.	Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM	2012	dev	0	23	0	Hepatic dysfunction is associated with vitamin D deficiency and poor glycemic control in diabetes mellitus.  BACKGROUND/AIMS: The effect of the rising prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease on the 25-hydroxylation of pre-vitamin D in the liver, and consequent glycemic control in children with diabetes mellitus is not known. Our aim was to determine whether mild hepatic dysfunction was associated with impaired 25-hydroxylation of pre-vitamin D, and if this vitamin D deficiency was associated with impaired glycemic control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). METHODS: We analyzed simultaneously measured HbA1c, ALT, AST, and 25OHD levels and clinical parameters in 121 children and adolescents with T1DM (n=81) and T2DM (n=40). The subjects, ages 11-21 years, all had diabetes of >6 months duration. Multivariate linear regression was used to analyze the associations, while comparisons between subgroups were made using two-tailed Student's t-test. RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency (25OHD <15 ng/mL (37.5 nmol/L) was more prevalent in T2DM patients (47.5%) compared to T1DM patients (18.5%). Subjects with T2DM had significantly elevated transaminases (AST 39.3 +/- 2.0 vs. 22.4 +/- 1.4, p<0.001; ALT 30.6 +/- 1.8 vs. 18.7 +/- 1.3, p<0.001) compared to TIDM patients, and demonstrated a significant inverse relationship between their HbA1c and 25OHD levels (beta=-0.42, p=0.02), compared to T1DM subjects (beta=-0.06, p=0.62). CONCLUSIONS: The association of elevated ALT with vitamin D deficiency suggests that hepatic dysfunction could impair vitamin D metabolism and negatively impact glycemic control in youth with T2DM.  
31207126	Obesity in older adults: Effect of degree of weight loss on cardiovascular markers and medications.	Clinical obesity	2019	dev	14	9	0	Obesity in older adults: Effect of degree of weight loss on cardiovascular markers and medications.  Obesity worsens the age-related tendency towards cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Older adults are vulnerable to medication adverse effects. Intentional weight loss in older adults with obesity has been shown to improve cardiovascular and glycaemic markers. The effect of rapid weight loss induced by very-low-calorie diets (VLCDs) on these markers has not been evaluated in this group. In this 12-week study, participants were randomized to one of healthy eating, hypocaloric diet or VLCD, all combined with three times weekly exercise (Ex/HE, Ex/Diet, Ex/VLCD, respectively). The effects of these interventions on weight, blood pressure, lipids, glucose and HbA1c , inflammatory markers and cardiovascular and diabetes medication changes were measured. Weight loss was 3.7%, 5.1% and 11.1% in Ex/HE, Ex/Diet and Ex/VLCD, respectively. There were significant improvements in HbA1c in all groups, but by the greatest degree in Ex/VLCD (0.18 +/- 0.07%, 0.18 +/- 0.06% and 0.59 +/- 0.13%, respectively). Similar patterns were seen in total cholesterol (0.13 +/- 0.15, 0.21 +/- 0.11 and 0.53 +/- 0.13 mmol/L, respectively, P = .047), triglycerides (0.35 +/- 0.13, 0.20 +/- 0.10 and 0.51 +/- 0.09 mmol/L, respectively, P = .011) and systolic blood pressure (9 +/- 2, 2 +/- 3 and 14 +/- 3 mmHg respectively, P = .025). There were no between-group differences in fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, LDL-C and inflammatory markers. Reductions in anti-hypertensive or diabetes medication were made in 4/29, 7/36 and 16/37 participants in Ex/HE, Ex/Diet and Ex/VLCD, respectively (P = .017). Significant weight loss achieved with a VLCD gave rise to improvements in multiple cardiovascular risk markers, despite reduction in medication. Weight loss is an under-utilized method of cardiovascular risk management in this group.  
19919514	The nutritive value of selected commonly consumed Kuwaiti dishes.	International journal of food sciences and nutrition	2009	dev	23	0	0	The nutritive value of selected commonly consumed Kuwaiti dishes.  The nutritive value of 33 dishes commonly consumed in the state of Kuwait was analyzed. On a fresh weight basis, the moisture content of the dishes ranged from 0.29% to 94.37%, protein content from 0.65% to 24.80%, and fat content from 0.03% to 59.22%. The crude fiber ranged from a low value of 0.04% to a maximum of 2.31%; with the exception of four dishes-Sw-20 (Samsamia), Sw-26 (Harda), V-31 (Hameesat Mushroom), V-32 (Hameesat Fagae)-all dishes had a low fiber level, <1 g/100 g. The ash content ranged from 0.09% to 3.66%. Carbohydrate showed a variation between 3.98% and 81.37%; the highest carbohydrate values were in sweets and rice-based dishes, while the lowest values were in soup and cheese dishes. The energy content of the dishes varied between 19 and 675 kcal/100 g (80-2,823 kJ/100 g). The dishes contributed 5-90%, 1-46% and 1-83% of the total food energy from carbohydrate, protein and fat, respectively.  
32510685	Artificial vs natural Stachybotrys infestation-Comparison of mycotoxin production on various building materials.	Indoor air	2020	dev	17	0	0	Artificial vs natural Stachybotrys infestation-Comparison of mycotoxin production on various building materials.  The genus Stachybotrys belongs to filamentous fungi found in indoor environment, mostly on cellulose-rich substrates after water-damage. The major purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of different building materials in case of mold infestation on the mycotoxin production of Stachybotrys species. Fifteen Stachybotrys mycotoxins including satratoxins, phenylspirodrimanes, and recently discovered stachybotrychromenes were in the focus of the investigations. Artificial and natural infestations were compared to determine whether environmental factors, for example, time of growth, temperature, humidity, and material additives have an influence on the observed mycotoxin profiles. It turned out that mycotoxin profiles from Stachybotrys spp. on building materials can be influenced by cellulose, paints, and paste of the materials. The total toxin levels of artificially and naturally contaminated gypsum board samples ranged up to 30 microg/cm(2) , whereas wallpaper samples showed total toxin levels in the range of 20-66 microg/cm(2) . A naturally infested sample disclosed the conversion of the dialdehyde components to the corresponding lactone isomers under the influence of light.

They also organize the way problems are discussed as well as the solution that are seen as effective. The authors review the literature on metaphor in psychotherapy and explore common psychotherapeutic metaphors such as ""psychotherapy is war,"" ""the mind is a brittle object,"" ""the conduit metaphor,"" and a variety of somatic metaphors.

31570970	Incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes by occupation: results from all Swedish employees.	Diabetologia	2020	dev	13	6	0	Incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes by occupation: results from all Swedish employees.  AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The workplace is a potentially important arena for prevention of type 2 diabetes and the first step is to identify occupations where the disease is common and/or risk is high. Therefore, our aim was to analyse incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes across all occupational groups in Sweden. METHODS: This nationwide study included all Swedish citizens born between 1937 and 1979 and gainfully employed between 2001 and 2013 (N = 4,550,892), and followed for a diagnosis of diabetes from 2006 to 2015 (n = 201,717) through national registers. Prevalence in 2013 (mean age 51 years; range 35-67) and age-standardised incidence (per 1000 person-years) were analysed across the 30 most common occupations among men and women. Information on BMI, physical fitness and smoking was obtained through the National Conscription (mean age 18) and Medical Birth Registers (mean age 29). RESULTS: Prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 5.2% in men and 3.2% in women; in men it was highest among motor vehicle drivers (8.8%) and in women it was highest among manufacturing workers (6.4%). Incidence varied dramatically across occupational groups. In men, it was highest among manufacturing workers (9.41) and professional drivers (9.32) and lowest among university teachers (3.44). In women, incidence was highest in manufacturing workers (7.20) and cleaners (6.18) and lowest in physiotherapists (2.20). We found major differences in the prevalence of being overweight and smoking and in the level of physical fitness across these occupational groups even at young ages. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Professional drivers, manufacturing workers and cleaners have a threefold increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared with university teachers and physiotherapists. These differences most likely reflect dramatic differences in the prevalence of lifestyle risk factors. If workplace interventions could reduce weight and increase physical activity among employees in these occupations, major health gains may be made.  
29599426	Occupational and leisure time physical inactivity and the risk of type II diabetes and hypertension among Mexican adults: A prospective cohort study.	Scientific reports	2018	dev	9	13	5	Occupational and leisure time physical inactivity and the risk of type II diabetes and hypertension among Mexican adults: A prospective cohort study.  There is a lack of longitudinal data linking physical inactivity and chronic diseases among Mexicans. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between total, leisure and occupational moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and incidence of type II diabetes (T2D) and hypertension in the Mexico City Diabetes Study. Study design and population. A prospective cohort study was conducted from 1989 to 2009 among 2282 men and non-pregnant women residing in six low-income neighborhoods in Mexico City. MAIN OUTCOME: Incidence of T2D and hypertension. RESULTS: After controlling for confounders, <1 MET/min/week of MVPA during leisure time was associated with higher risk of hypertension (HR 1.29, CI 95% 1.01, 1.66) and T2D (HR 1.31 CI 95% 1.00, 1.74). In addition, accumulating <1 MET/min/week of occupational MVPA was associated with higher risk of hypertension (HR 1.47, CI 95% 1.13, 1.90). CONCLUSION: The absence of leisure and occupational MVPA was associated with an increased risk of hypertension. However, no associations were found between occupational MVPA and T2D.  
32761416	Kiwifruit Skin and Flesh Contributions to Fecal Bulking and Bacterial Abundance in Rats.	Plant foods for human nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands)	2020	dev	12	0	0	Kiwifruit Skin and Flesh Contributions to Fecal Bulking and Bacterial Abundance in Rats.  Changes in fecal bulk and bacterial abundance due to separately consumed skin and flesh of four kiwifruit cultivars was determined using a rat model designed to estimate the fecal bulking potential of human foods. Dry matter contribution by skin to 100 g of fresh kiwifruit was less than 5% in all cultivars, whereas flesh dry matter contributed up to 20% of fresh fruit weight. Dietary fiber was 35-49% of skin compared with 8-23% of flesh on a dry weight basis. The skin significantly increased whole fruit fecal bulking, but the total bulk per 100 g kiwifruit was less than 10% of daily fecal bulk recommended for optimal gut health. Kiwifruit (skin or flesh) substantially increased the abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Lactobacillus spp. within the gut. Fermentation and prebiosis therefore probably play a greater role than fermentation-resistant dietary fiber in gut health benefits of kiwifruit.  
34621627	Occupational Skin Diseases among Building Construction Workers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.	Annals of global health	2021	dev	6	12	5	Occupational Skin Diseases among Building Construction Workers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.  Background: Amongst established growing industries worldwide, the construction industry contributes about 7.5% of the world labor force and 16.4% of global occupational diseases and accidents. A variety of activities are practiced in construction work, such as masonry, painting, welding, carpentry, plastering, concrete and cement mixing. These may eventually lead to exposures that can subject the workers to risks of developing occupational skin diseases. Most studies done on the construction industry in Tanzania have focused on effects such as injuries, respiratory problems and ergonomics; very little research has been done on skin diseases. Objectives: The study aimed at assessing the prevalence of occupational skin diseases, associated factors and preventive measures among building construction workers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Methods: Construction sites and participants were selected using simple random sampling. The Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire (NOSQ) was adapted and used for assessing the development of skin diseases among constructions workers. Analysis of categorical variables, associated factors and skin preventive measures was done using Chi-square tests. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio for factors indicating an influence on the occurrence of skin diseases. Findings: The study consisted of 420 building construction workers from different sites with a mean age of 32.7 years. The participants were masons, assistant masons and carpenters. The mean work duration was 6 years. Occupational Skin diseases were prevalent in 228 (54%) workers. Carpenters had a higher prevalence of skin diseases 12(67%), followed by assistant masons 43 (64%). Timely provision of safety trainings and of PPE utility, training and guidance lowered the occurrence of skin diseases. Conclusion: A high number of construction workers experienced skin diseases, especially those who have worked for more than 4 years. Workers who received safety training before the work shift had lesser prevalence of skin diseases compared to those who did not. Receiving proper information on PPE usage and proper wearing of gloves had a protective effect.  
20371422	Childhood incident asthma and traffic-related air pollution at home and school.	Environmental health perspectives	2010	dev	17	10	5	Childhood incident asthma and traffic-related air pollution at home and school.  BACKGROUND: Traffic-related air pollution has been associated with adverse cardiorespiratory effects, including increased asthma prevalence. However, there has been little study of effects of traffic exposure at school on new-onset asthma. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the relationship of new-onset asthma with traffic-related pollution near homes and schools. METHODS: Parent-reported physician diagnosis of new-onset asthma (n = 120) was identified during 3 years of follow-up of a cohort of 2,497 kindergarten and first-grade children who were asthma- and wheezing-free at study entry into the Southern California Children's Health Study. We assessed traffic-related pollution exposure based on a line source dispersion model of traffic volume, distance from home and school, and local meteorology. Regional ambient ozone, nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), and particulate matter were measured continuously at one central site monitor in each of 13 study communities. Hazard ratios (HRs) for new-onset asthma were scaled to the range of ambient central site pollutants and to the residential interquartile range for each traffic exposure metric. RESULTS: Asthma risk increased with modeled traffic-related pollution exposure from roadways near homes [HR 1.51; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.25-1.82] and near schools (HR 1.45; 95% CI, 1.06-1.98). Ambient NO(2) measured at a central site in each community was also associated with increased risk (HR 2.18; 95% CI, 1.18-4.01). In models with both NO(2) and modeled traffic exposures, there were independent associations of asthma with traffic-related pollution at school and home, whereas the estimate for NO(2) was attenuated (HR 1.37; 95% CI, 0.69-2.71). CONCLUSIONS: Traffic-related pollution exposure at school and homes may both contribute to the development of asthma.  
9801469	[Causes of cancer in Scandinavia and possible preventive measures].	Nordisk medicin	1998	dev	10	20	13	[Causes of cancer in Scandinavia and possible preventive measures].  The purpose of this work is to address future possibilities for avoiding cancer. We elucidate the most important known causes of cancer in the Nordic countries during the second half of this century and provide estimates of the numbers of cancer cases that might be avoided by the year 2000 if those causes were effectively eliminated. Information on the pattern of carcinogenic exposures in each of the five Nordic countries and the associated relative risk estimates from the scientific literature were obtained. The numbers of avoidable cancers were assessed on the basis of this information together with the associated population attributable risk percent, PAR%, i.e. the proportion of a given cancer that can be avoided upon elimination of the causative factor. The main causes of cancer include smoking, alcohol consumption, exposure to occupational carcinogens, radiation, obesity and infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and Helicobacter pylori. Annually, more than 18,000 cancers in men and 11,000 in women in the Nordic populations could be avoided by eliminating exposure to known carcinogens which is equivalent to 33 percent and 20 percent of all cancers arising in men and women, respectively, around the year 2000. Smoking habits account for a little more than half of these avoidable cases. Exposure to solar radiation, HPV and Helicobacter pylori, diagnostic and therapeutic radiation and consumption of alcohol play important roles in the causation of cancer, as each of these factors is linked with 1-5 percent of all cancers in men and women. Occupational exposures are also substantial causes in men (3 percent), and obesity is important in women (1 percent). In contrast, current knowledge is insufficient to give reliable estimates of the numbers of cancers that could be avoided by well-described modifications of dietary habits. These figures indicate that the most efficient way of reducing cancer morbidity would be to reduce the prevalence of exposure of the population to cancer-causing agents.  
32315982	Hemodynamic Function of Forearm Muscle in Postmenopausal Women With Type 2 Diabetes.	Journal of aging and physical activity	2020	dev	0	6	0	Hemodynamic Function of Forearm Muscle in Postmenopausal Women With Type 2 Diabetes.  Changes in the hemodynamic function of muscle are speculated as a causal mechanism for reduced motor capabilities with aging in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The focus of this study was to evaluate changes in muscle oxygenation during sustained force production in postmenopausal women with DM compared with controls. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor deoxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin in the flexor digitorum superficialis. Sensorimotor function and health state covariates were also assessed. Increased deoxyhemoglobin was found during force production, whereas oxyhemoglobin remained constant. Changes were found in the time structure of the hemodynamic data during force production. No between-group differences were found; instead, measures covaried with the health state. Sex-based differences in the manifestation of DM-related sensorimotor dysfunction are likely. These data indicate that basic cardiovascular health measures may be more beneficial to monitoring hyperemic status and muscle function in postmenopausal women with DM, compared with DM diagnosis.  
24051120	Polysomnographic abnormalities in patients with vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia.	Sleep medicine	2013	dev	29	16	22	Polysomnographic abnormalities in patients with vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia.  OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate subjective sleep quality and polysomnographic sleep structure features in patients with vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia (VCIND). METHODS: Fifty-six patients with VCIND, 48 patients with simple stroke (without cognitive impairment), and 48 control subjects were included. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and polysomnography (PSG) were used to analyze their sleep characteristics. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was conducted to assess mental state. RESULTS: Patients with VCIND had higher PSQI scores compared with control subjects and simple stroke patients (P<.01). PSG revealed that patients with VCIND or stroke were more likely to experience prolonged sleep latency (SL), decreased sleep efficiency (SE), increased arousal, and reduced deep sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep than controls. Patients with VCIND had significantly longer SL, increased periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS), decreased SE, and increased arousal and sleep fragmentation compared to patients with simple stroke (P<.05). In VCIND patients, a significant positive correlation was found between SE and MoCA scores (r=0.632; P<.001), though PSQI, SL, and arousal index were significantly negatively associated with MoCA scores (r=-0.787, -0.740, -0.772, respectively; P<.001 for all). CONCLUSIONS: VCIND patients had different abnormal sleep features, including decreased SE, increased PLMS, and prolonged SL and sleep fragmentation. Abnormal sleep in VCIND may be associated with cognitive impairment.

Two studies examined men's interventions in a virtual reality situation involving child grooming. In Study 1, 92 men observed an online encounter between an apparent minor and a sex offender. The results suggest that the bystander effect was stronger under computerized rather than user-assisted surveillance, and when the fellow cyberbystander was unknown rather than known. In Study 2, where 100 men observed the same encounter, the effect also emerged under computerized surveillance as long as the number unknown cyberbystanders was increased. Thus, vesting more responsibility for security in the average netizen rather than just in the automated abuse-detection technology is cautiously suggested, the relevance of which lies in increasing minors' health and safety.  
28057447	Antidepressant Prescribing by Pediatricians: A Mixed-Methods Analysis.	Current problems in pediatric and adolescent health care	2017	dev	4	14	0	"Antidepressant Prescribing by Pediatricians: A Mixed-Methods Analysis.  Among pediatricians, perceived knowledge of efficacy, tolerability, dosing, and side effects of antidepressants represent significant sources of variability in the use of these medications in youth with depressive and anxiety disorders. Importantly, the qualitative factors that relate to varying levels of comfort with antidepressants and willingness to prescribe are poorly understood. Using a mixed-methods approach, in-depth interviews were conducted with community-based and academic medical center-based pediatricians (N = 14). Interviews were audio recorded and iteratively coded; themes were then generated using inductive thematic analysis. The relationship between demographic factors, knowledge of antidepressants, dosing, and side effects, as well as prescribing likelihood scores for depressive disorders, anxiety disorders or co-morbid anxiety and depressive disorders, were evaluated using mixed models. Pediatricians reported antidepressants to be effective and well-tolerated. However, the likelihood of individual physicians initiating an antidepressant was significantly lower for anxiety disorders relative to depressive disorders with similar functional impairment. Pediatricians considered symptom severity/functional impairment, age and the availability of psychotherapy as they considered prescribing antidepressants to individual patients. Antidepressant choice was related to the physician's perceived knowledge and comfort with a particular antidepressant, financial factors, and the disorder-specific evidence base for that particular medication and consultation with mental health practitioners. Pediatricians noted similar efficacy and tolerability profiles for antidepressants in youth with depressive disorders and anxiety disorders, but tended to utilize ""therapy first"" approaches for anxiety disorders relative to depressive disorders. Parental and family factors that influenced prescribing of antidepressants by pediatricians included parental ambivalence, family-related dysfunction and impairment secondary to the child's psychopathology as well as the child's psychosocial milieu. Pediatricians consider patient- and family-specific challenges when choosing prescribing antidepressant medications and are, in general, less likely to prescribe antidepressants for youth with anxiety disorders compared to youth with depressive disorders. The lower likelihood of prescribing antidepressants for anxious youth is not related to perception of the efficacy or tolerability, but rather to a perception that anxiety disorders are less impairing and more appropriately managed with psychotherapy.

11078758	Prospective study of fruit and vegetable consumption and risk of lung cancer among men and women.	Journal of the National Cancer Institute	2000	dev	25	8	8	Prospective study of fruit and vegetable consumption and risk of lung cancer among men and women.  BACKGROUND: Diets high in fruits and vegetables have been shown to be associated with a lower risk of lung cancer. beta-Carotene was hypothesized to be largely responsible for the apparent protective effect, but this hypothesis was not supported by clinical trials. METHODS: We examined the association between lung cancer risk and fruit and vegetable consumption in 77 283 women in the Nurses' Health Study and 47 778 men in the Health Professionals' Follow-up Study. Diet was assessed with the use of a food-frequency questionnaire that included 15 fruits and 23 vegetables. We used logistic regression models to estimate relative risks (RRs) of lung cancer within each cohort. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We documented 519 lung cancer cases among the women and 274 among the men. Total fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with a modestly lower risk of lung cancer among the women but not among the men. The RR for the highest versus lowest quintile of intake was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.59-1.06) among the women and 1.12 (95% CI = 0.74-1.69) among the men after adjustment for smoking status, quantity of cigarettes smoked per day, time since quitting smoking, and age at initiation of smoking. However, total fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with a lower risk of lung cancer among never smokers in the combined cohorts, although the reduction was not statistically significant (RR = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.35-1.12 in the highest tertile). CONCLUSION: Higher fruit and vegetable intakes were associated with lower risks of lung cancer in women but not in men. It is possible that the inverse association among the women remained confounded by unmeasured smoking characteristics, although fruits and vegetables were protective in both men and women who never smoked.  
23849002	The relationship between young adults' beliefs about anonymity and subsequent cyber aggression.	Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking	2013	dev	7	0	0	The relationship between young adults' beliefs about anonymity and subsequent cyber aggression.  Anonymity is considered a key motivator for cyber aggression, but few investigations have focused on the connection between anonymity and the subsequent engagement in aggression through the cyber context. The present longitudinal study utilized structural equation modeling to reveal indirect associations between two types of anonymity (i.e., punishment by authority figures and retaliation from the target) and later cyber aggression among 130 young adults. These relationships were examined through the influence of beliefs about not getting caught and not believing in the permanency of online content. Findings indicated that both forms of anonymity were related to cyber aggression 6 months later through two explanatory mechanisms (i.e., confidence with not getting caught and believing online content is not permanent), after controlling for gender and cyber aggression at Time 1. The implications of these findings are discussed, and an appeal for additional research investigating cyber aggression among young adults is given.  
26897639	Clinical Profile, Acute Care, and Middle-Term Outcomes of Cocaine-Associated ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction in an Inner-City Community.	The American journal of cardiology	2016	dev	16	13	6	Clinical Profile, Acute Care, and Middle-Term Outcomes of Cocaine-Associated ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction in an Inner-City Community.  Although cocaine is a well-recognized risk factor for coronary disease, detailed information is lacking regarding related behavioral and clinical features of cocaine-associated ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged urban settings. Nor are systematic or extended follow-up data available on outcomes for cocaine-associated STEMI in the contemporary era of percutaneous coronary intervention. We leveraged a prospective STEMI registry from a large health system serving an inner-city community to characterize the clinical features, acute management, and middle-term outcomes of cocaine-related versus cocaine-unrelated STEMI. Of the 1,003 patients included, 60% were black or Hispanic. Compared with cocaine-unrelated STEMI, cocaine-related STEMI (n = 58) was associated with younger age, male gender, lower socioeconomic score, current smoking, high alcohol consumption, and human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity but less commonly with diabetes or hypertension. Cocaine users less often received drug-eluting stents or beta blockers at discharge. During median follow-up of 2.7 years, rates of death, death or any rehospitalization, and death or cardiovascular rehospitalization did not differ significantly between cocaine users and nonusers but were especially high for death or any hospitalization in the 2 groups (31.4 vs 32.4 per 100 person-years, p = 0.887). Adjusted hazard ratios for outcomes were likewise not significantly different. In conclusion, in this low-income community, cocaine use occurred in a substantial fraction of STEMI cases, who were younger than their nonuser counterparts but had more prevalent high-risk habits and exhibited similarly high rates of adverse outcomes. These data suggest that programs targeting cocaine abuse and related behaviors could contribute importantly to disease prevention in disadvantaged communities.  
3227224	The development of scales to measure the experience of self-participation in sleep.	Sleep	1988	dev	5	0	0	The development of scales to measure the experience of self-participation in sleep.  Recent literature suggests that how the self is represented is a cardinal aspect of the dream experience. A review of studies of phasic-tonic distinctions within rapid eye movement (REM) sleep revealed that increasing self-participation marked awakenings from phasic intervals. Five scales specifically designed to measure absorption in dreaming were compared with three scales previously shown to discriminate phasic from tonic awakenings within REM sleep. Eight reports per night (two stage REM, six stage 2) were collected from each of 20 subjects on 4 baseline nights. Awakenings were controlled for time into the REMP and time of night, correcting the methodological flaws of previous studies in this area. Scales developed to measure self-participation were able to discriminate phasic from tonic awakenings better than those already in the literature. Results are discussed in terms of the psychometric properties of the individual scales.  
25060996	Low vitamin D levels are common in patients with epilepsy.	Epilepsy research	2014	dev	3	16	1	Low vitamin D levels are common in patients with epilepsy.  PURPOSE: Vitamin D is important for bone health, and vitamin D deficiency may contribute to other disorders (e.g., autoimmune, infections, cancer, degenerative, diabetic, and vascular). Enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs have been particularly implicated for osteoporosis risk given their effects on vitamin D. We examined the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in adult epilepsy patients. METHODS: We conducted an observational study of consecutive epilepsy patients treated by two clinicians at the Emory University Epilepsy Center from 2008 to 2011 in order to determine the frequency of low vitamin D levels and possible differential antiepileptic drug risks. Vitamin D 25-OH levels were categorized as low (<20 ng/ml), borderline (20-29 ng/ml), or normal (>=30 ng/ml). Antiepileptic drugs were categorized based on their enzyme inducing properties. Descriptive and inferential statistics were employed. RESULTS: Vitamin D levels were obtained on 596 patients with epilepsy. Mean age was 41 years (SD=14; range=18-81); 56% were women. Race/ethnicity was 55% Caucasian, 34% Black, 2% Asian, and 7% Unknown. The mean vitamin D level was 22.5 (SD=11.9; range = <4 to 98), and 45% had level <20 ng/ml. Mean vitamin D levels (F=6.48, p=.002) and frequencies of vitamin D categories (p=.002, Chi square test) differed across the antiepileptic drug groups. Vitamin D deficiency was present in 54% of enzyme-inducing and 37% of non-enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs groups. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with epilepsy on antiepileptic drugs. Monitoring of vitamin D should be considered as part of the routine management of patients with epilepsy.  
2035006	[Bronchial asthma and kitchen salt].	Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift	1991	dev	21	6	5	[Bronchial asthma and kitchen salt].  Epidemiological studies show considerable geographic differences in asthma prevalence and mortality. The regions with high prevalence and mortality are countries with Western-type culture and a high degree of technological progress. They differ from less technically developed countries in a number of ways, including their higher salt intake. Air pollution is often given as the cause of the high prevalence of asthma in the industrialized countries. Against this, it must be pointed out that in the urban agglomerations of the developing countries and in rural areas where heating is by means of open fireplaces (indoor pollution), there is also considerable air pollution. Migration studies from New Zealand and South Africa, where asthma prevalence increases parallel to salt intake, provide evidence that other factors arising from westernization and urbanization play a role. In the industrialized countries England and USA there is also a clear connection between salt intake and asthma: the greater the salt consumption, the higher the asthma prevalence and mortality. On the basis of these observations, the following questions were investigated: (1.) Does salt loading worsen the clinical and functional findings in asthmatics? (2.) Is the sodium or the chloride in salt the more important? To answer these questions, the effect of salt loading (+6.1 +/- 2.8 g NaCl/d = 105 +/- 48 mmol Na), salt restriction, and loading with sodium citrate in equimolar concentrations (+140 +/- 40 ml Shohl's solution = 120 +/- 34 mmol Na) was investigated in 14 asthmatics in a controlled crossover study. Statistical analysis showed that salt intake worsened symptoms (p = 0.06) and increased the use of inhaled steroids (p less than or equal to 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  
28734988	Can adverse effects of excessive vitamin D supplementation occur without developing hypervitaminosis D?	The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology	2018	dev	12	10	7	Can adverse effects of excessive vitamin D supplementation occur without developing hypervitaminosis D?  Vitamin D is a fat-soluble hormone that has endocrine, paracrine and autocrine functions. Consumption of vitamin D-supplemented food & drugs have increased significantly in the last couple of decades due to campaign and awareness programs. Despite such wide use of artificial vitamin D supplements, serum level of 25 hydroxyvitamin D does not always reflect the amount of uptake. In contrast to the safe sunlight exposure, prolonged and disproportionate consumption of vitamin D supplements may lead to vitamin D intoxication, even without developing hypervitaminosis D. One of the reasons why vitamin D supplementation is believed to be safe is, it rarely raises serum vitamin D levels to the toxic range even after repeated intravenous ingestion of extremely high doses of synthetic vitamin D analogs. However, prolonged consumption of vitamin D supplementation may induce hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia, which are considered to be the initial signs of vitamin D intoxication. It is likely that calcium and phosphorus dysregulation, induced by exogenous vitamin D supplementation, may lead to tissue and organ damages, even without developing hypervitaminosis D. It is needed to be emphasized that, because of tight homeostatic control of calcium and phosphorus, when hypercalcemia and/or hyperphosphatemia is apparent following vitamin D supplementation, the process of tissue and/or organ damage might already have been started.  
11397709	High-fat, high-cholesterol diet increases the incidence of gastritis in LDL receptor-negative mice.	Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology	2001	dev	7	11	5	High-fat, high-cholesterol diet increases the incidence of gastritis in LDL receptor-negative mice.  Transgenic and knockout mice are widely used as models for atherogenesis studies. While developing a Helicobacter infection model in LDL receptor-negative (LDLR(-/-)) mice, we noticed that mice fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet often contracted gastritis independent of infection. To further investigate this finding, we studied 27 male and 18 female LDLR(-/-) mice fed high-fat, 1% or 1.25% cholesterol diets for 3 to 4 months. The extent of atherosclerosis was morphometrically analyzed in the whole aorta, and the degree of gastric inflammation was scored histologically in hematoxylin-eosin-stained stomach sections. The autoantibody titers to epitopes of oxidized LDL were also measured. Mice fed high-fat, high-cholesterol diets had a significantly higher incidence of gastritis than mice fed normal chow, 62% versus 5%, respectively (P<0.0001). This effect was specific for LDLR(-/-) mice, because no difference in gastritis was found in wild-type mice fed either diet. Animals with gastritis showed slightly more atherosclerosis than animals without gastritis: 16.3+/-6.4% versus 12.8+/-3.4% in males and 9.4+/-3.5% versus 6.5+/-3.3% in females. Cholesterol-fed mice also had significantly higher IgG autoantibody titers against modified LDL than normal chow-fed animals, but no difference was seen between the gastritis and nongastritis groups. We conclude that the standard high-fat, high-cholesterol diet commonly used in many murine models to induce atherosclerosis increased the incidence of gastritis significantly in LDLR(-/-) mice.  
10516985	Nutrition and dietary supplements.	Physical medicine and rehabilitation clinics of North America	1999	dev	48	10	10	Nutrition and dietary supplements.  Quality and number of subjects in blinded controlled clinical trials about the nutrition and dietary supplements discussed here is variable. Glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate have sufficient controlled trials to warrant their use in osteoarthritis, having less side effects than currently used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and are the only treatment shown to prevent progression of the disease. Dietary supplements of ephedrine plus caffeine for weight loss (weight loss being the current first line recommendation of physicians for osteoporosis) show some promise, but are not sufficient in number of study subjects. Phenylpropanolamine is proven successful in weight loss. Both ephedrine and phenylpropanolamine have resulted in deaths and hence are worrisome [table: see text] as an over-the-counter dietary supplement. Other commonly used weight loss supplements like Cola acuminata, dwarf elder, Yohimbine, and Garcinia camborgia are either lacking controlled clinical trials, or in the case of the last two supplements, have clinical trials showing lack of effectiveness (although Garcinia has been successful in trials as part of a mixture with other substances, it is unclear if it was a necessary part of the mixture). Safety of these weight loss supplements is unknown. Chromium as a body building supplement for athletes appears to have no efficacy. Creatine may help more in weight lifting than sprinting, but insufficient study subjects and safety information make more studies necessary. Carbohydrate loading is used commonly before endurance competitions, but may be underused as it may be beneficial for other sport performances. Supplements for muscle injury or cramps have had too few studies to determine efficacy. Although proper rehydration with fluids and electrolytes is necessary, a paucity of actual studies to maximize prophylactic treatment for exercise induced cramping still exists. Nutritional supplements for cardiovascular disorders are generally geared to prevention. The United States Department of Agriculture has good recommendations to prevent atherosclerosis; a stricter version by Ornish was shown to reverse coronary heart disease, and the low meat, high fruit, and vegetable DASH diet has been found to decrease hypertension. The epidemiologic studies of hyperhomocysteinemia are impressive enough to give folic acid (or vitamin B6 or B12) supplements to those with elevated homocysteine levels and test patients who have a history of atherosclerotic disease, but no controlled clinical trials have been completed. Soluble fiber has several positive studies in reduction of cholesterol levels and generally is accepted. The data on vitamin E are the most confusing. This vitamin was not helpful in cerebrovascular prevention in China and not helpful at relatively small doses (50 mg) in the United States or Finland against major coronary events. Levels of 400 mg appeared to decrease cardiovascular disease in the United States in studies based on reports by patients and in one large clinical trial. Vitamin E also was successful in prevention of restenosis after PTCA in one clinical trial. Both of these clinical trials need to be repeated in other developed country populations. Some nutritional and dietary supplements are justifiably useful at this point in time. Several meet the criteria of a late Phase 3 FDA clinical trial (where it would be released for public use), but many dietary supplements have insufficient numbers of studies. Some deaths also have occurred with some supplements. If these supplements were required to undergo clinical trials necessary for a new drug by the FDA, they would not be released yet to the public. Several nontoxic supplements appear promising, though need further study. Because they have essentially no toxicity (such as folic acid with B12, soluble fiber, and vitamin E) and may have efficacy, some of these supplementations may be useful now, without randomized clinical trials.  
12766445	First Year Impacts of Casino Gambling in a Community.	Journal of gambling studies	1998	dev	9	2	0	First Year Impacts of Casino Gambling in a Community.  Gambling has become both a major pastime for Canadians and a multibillion dollar industry providing provincial governments with an increasing proportion of their annual revenues. The continuing trend toward the legalization of gambling has made research on the public health impacts of gambling increasingly important to citizens and decision-makers. This article presents first year results of a multi-year project to measure the impact of the opening of Casino Windsor on gambling behaviour in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. A random telephone survey of gambling behaviour was conducted with 2,682 adult residents of metropolitan Windsor prior to the opening of Casino Windsor, and was repeated with 2,581 residents one year later. There were no statistically significant changes in the rates of problem and pathological gambling among men, women, or the general population one year following the opening of the casino. Although there was some evidence of higher-spending gamblers within the post-casino sample, no statistically significant differences were found between pre- and post-casino per capita gambling expenditures. Implications of these results for the future measurement and treatment of problem and pathological gambling are discussed.  
31290760	Sleep quality and fatigue in women with premature ovarian insufficiency receiving hormone therapy: a comparative study.	Menopause (New York, N.Y.)	2019	dev	10	10	4	Sleep quality and fatigue in women with premature ovarian insufficiency receiving hormone therapy: a comparative study.  OBJECTIVE: To compare sleep quality and fatigue between women with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) receiving hormone therapy (HT) and women of the same age with preserved ovarian function. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 61 women with POI receiving HT (POI group) and 61 women with preserved ovarian function (control group) who were matched by age (+/-2 years). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Chalder Fatigue Scale were used to assess sleep quality and fatigue. Apart from correlation analysis, the Mann-Whitney, chi-square, or Fisher test was used to compare the groups. RESULTS: Women from the POI and control groups were 35.03 +/- 7.68 and 34.49 +/- 7.55 years of age, respectively (P = 0.63). In the PSQI evaluation, the scores were 7.69 +/- 4.18 and 8.03 +/- 4.53, respectively (P = 0.79), showing no difference between the POI and control groups. However, the POI group had higher and therefore worse scores for the sleep latency component (1.74 +/- 0.66 and 1.18 +/- 0.87, respectively; P < 0.001) and use of medication to sleep (1.28 +/- 0.88 and 0. 85 +/- 0.8; P = 0.008). The POI group had a higher fatigue index than that of the control group (5.25 +/- 2.78 and 3.49 +/- 1.78, respectively; P < 0.001), with sleep quality being classified as poor in 69% and fatigue present in 59% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Women with POI receiving HT have poor sleep quality. They take longer to fall asleep and have a higher fatigue index.  
3158473	Work-related hand eczema in atopics.	Contact dermatitis	1985	dev	11	10	6	Work-related hand eczema in atopics.  549 individuals with severe (group 1), 406 with moderate (group 2) atopic dermatitis in childhood, 222 with respiratory allergy but no atopic dermatitis in childhood (group 3), and 199 without personal or family atopy (group 4) were studied as to occupational health symptoms due to hand eczema. In groups 1, 2 and 4, there was a slightly significant difference (P less than 0.05) between the frequency of hand eczema in individuals with and without occupational exposure to chemicals, water, soil or wear (friction). Despite no such work, 55% in group 1 and 44% in group 2 had developed hand eczema. About 1/4 of the atopics in extreme risk occupations, such as ladies' hairdressers and nursing assistants, had not developed hand eczema. Altogether, 9% in groups 1 and 2 and 3% in group 4 had changed their jobs due to hand eczema, the majority from work with to work without exposure to chemicals, water, soil or wear. Social factors had usually contributed to the change. The healing rate after taking up a new occupation was 15% in group 1, 36% in group 2 and 67% (4 out of 6) in group 4. The majority of the patients whose eczema had not healed had improved in their new occupations. It is claimed that medical reasons for change of occupation should be carefully weighed against social reasons.  
10398936	Occupational physical activity and breast cancer risk in the upper Cape Cod cancer incidence study.	American journal of industrial medicine	1999	dev	12	6	3	Occupational physical activity and breast cancer risk in the upper Cape Cod cancer incidence study.  BACKGROUND: In several epidemiological studies, breast cancer risk has been reduced among women who reported high levels of occupational or leisure-time physical activity. We used data from a population-based case control study to evaluate the effect of occupational physical activity on breast cancer risk. METHODS: Two hundred-thirty three incident cases of breast cancer and 670 controls or their next of kin were interviewed for information on breast cancer risk factors and a complete job history. Physical activity level of jobs were classified using a Department of Labor rating scheme. We calculated adjusted odds ratios for light and medium/heavy activity jobs compared to sedentary jobs. RESULTS: Odds ratios for women who held medium/heavy jobs for less than 10 years and more than ten years were, respectively, 0.7 (95% CI = 0.4,1.3) and 1.7 (95% CI = 0.9,3.3). CONCLUSIONS: In these data there was no evidence that holding a job of medium/heavy activity reduced breast cancer risk. The study was limited by misclassification inherent in the occupational exposure scheme and by the lack of information on leisure time physical activity. The modest risk increase for subjects holding a medium/heavy job for at least 10 years probably represents either confounding or random variation.  
34037226	COVID-19 exposure and diagnosis among college student drinkers: links to alcohol use behavior, motives, and context.	Translational behavioral medicine	2021	dev	18	11	5	COVID-19 exposure and diagnosis among college student drinkers: links to alcohol use behavior, motives, and context.  The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health crisis. College student alcohol use is highly prevalent and primarily occurs in social settings where risk for COVID-19 transmission is heightened. This study explored the associations between alcohol use frequency, quantity, motives, and context with: (i) quarantine due to COVID-19 exposure and (ii) a positive diagnosis for COVID-19. A sample of n = 409 college student drinkers completed an online survey about their health and behaviors during the Fall 2020 semester. Since the start of the semester, 36% of students quarantined and 13% of students received a COVID-19 diagnosis. More frequent alcohol use was associated with increased odds of both quarantine and COVID-19 diagnosis. More frequent drinking for social motives was associated with increased likelihood of quarantine, and more frequent drinking for conformity motives was associated with increased likelihood of COVID-19 diagnosis. Participants who often drank alone or with a small group of friends were about half as likely to have quarantined, while those who often drank with a large group of friends were almost twice as likely to have quarantined. Participants who often drank in a bar or nightclub had almost three times the odds of a COVID-19 diagnosis. Frequent alcohol use and drinking for social and conformity motives and in certain contexts are linked to increased likelihood of COVID-19 exposure and diagnosis. Alcohol use prevention efforts, coupled with messaging to discourage large social gatherings in public places, might help to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among college students.  
34311714	Understanding factors relevant to poor sleep and coping methods in people with schizophrenia.	BMC psychiatry	2021	dev	22	8	1	Understanding factors relevant to poor sleep and coping methods in people with schizophrenia.  BACKGROUND: Sleep disruption is pervasive in people with schizophrenia, but few studies have explored their sleep experiences. This study aims to identify factors relevant to sleep problems and explore coping methods used by community-dwelling people with schizophrenia. METHODS: Eighteen participants with schizophrenia were recruited from three mental health centers in Taiwan. They completed a semi-structured interview and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) assessment. The Person-Environment-Occupation model offered a framework to assess factors related to sleep. Thematic analysis was used for the qualitative data analysis. RESULTS: Factors related to sleep were classified under person, environment, and occupation domains. The person domain included three subthemes: psychiatric symptoms, unpleasant emotions, and frustration about sleep. The environment domain included three subthemes: sensory intrusions from the environment, quality of bedding, and roommates. The occupation domain included sleep interruption and sleep preparation. There were notable discrepancies in sleep quality between the participants' narratives and their PSQI global scores. Regarding coping methods for poor sleep, sleep medication was the primary strategy while some participants also used other strategies, such as modifying the environment, adjusting routines, or engaging in activities that improve sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric symptoms and nightmares were identified as unique sleep disruptions in people with schizophrenia, and poor economic status was also found to impact their sleep. The sleep quality of people with schizophrenia tends to be poor, as identified by the PSQI, even though they may have positive perceptions of their sleep quality. Our participants appeared to prefer to take hypnotics to address their sleep problems, which may be due to limited knowledge about alternatives. Mental health professionals are encouraged to receive training in the application of non-pharmacological approaches to support their clients' issues related to sleep.  
29383147	Cigarette smoke enhances initiation and progression of lung cancer by mutating Notch1/2 and dysregulating downstream signaling molecules.	Oncotarget	2017	dev	16	14	8	Cigarette smoke enhances initiation and progression of lung cancer by mutating Notch1/2 and dysregulating downstream signaling molecules.  Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer related deaths in the western world and smoking significantly increases the risk of developing lung cancer. Smoking enhances lung cancer initiation and progression. The effects of cigarette smoke on lung cancer are mediated by the presence of highly mutagenic substances, including nicotine, leading to mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. An emerging pathway in cancer is the Notch signaling pathway which is essential for embryonic lung development and tissue homeostasis. The role of Notch signaling in lung cancer remains controversial and no studies have directly linked cigarette exposure to mutations in Notch. Therefore, we investigated the direct effect of Notch signaling pathways on cigarette-induced lung tumors and the correlation between smoking and mutations in Notch leading to altered downstream signaling. Human cell lines, mouse models and clinical lung cancer samples were utilized in this study. Cigarette-induced in vitro human lung cancer models and in vivo mouse models demonstrated strong effects of cigarette exposure on the Notch signaling pathway. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of 50 clinical samples collected from smokers and non-smokers with and without lung cancer also demonstrated a link between smoking and changes in Notch signaling. Finally, 34 lung cancer samples analyzed through direct sequencing indicated smoking significantly increased small nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Notch 1 and 2 and specific SNPs significantly modulated expression levels of downstream signaling pathway molecules. Taken together, these results demonstrate a direct effect of smoking on the Notch signaling pathway leading to lung cancer initiation and progression.  
18929315	Metabolic consequences of sleep and sleep loss.	Sleep medicine	2008	dev	15	7	6	Metabolic consequences of sleep and sleep loss.  Reduced sleep duration and quality appear to be endemic in modern society. Curtailment of the bedtime period to minimum tolerability is thought to be efficient and harmless by many. It has been known for several decades that sleep is a major modulator of hormonal release, glucose regulation and cardiovascular function. In particular, slow wave sleep (SWS), thought to be the most restorative sleep stage, is associated with decreased heart rate, blood pressure, sympathetic nervous activity and cerebral glucose utilization, compared with wakefulness. During SWS, the anabolic growth hormone is released while the stress hormone cortisol is inhibited. In recent years, laboratory and epidemiologic evidence have converged to indicate that sleep loss may be a novel risk factor for obesity and type 2 diabetes. The increased risk of obesity is possibly linked to the effect of sleep loss on hormones that play a major role in the central control of appetite and energy expenditure, such as leptin and ghrelin. Reduced leptin and increased ghrelin levels correlate with increases in subjective hunger when individuals are sleep restricted rather than well rested. Given the evidence, sleep curtailment appears to be an important, yet modifiable, risk factor for the metabolic syndrome, diabetes and obesity. The marked decrease in average sleep duration in the last 50 years coinciding with the increased prevalence of obesity, together with the observed adverse effects of recurrent partial sleep deprivation on metabolism and hormonal processes, may have important implications for public health.

Influence on face in profile and on dentition.  The treatment effects of Hansaplate/headgear in the course of 1 year were analyzed. Twenty-one girls and 19 boys, 10 and 11 years old, respectively, with postnormal occlusion and an average overjet of 8 mm, made up the treatment group. Forty untreated patients with the same type of malocclusion and dentofacial morphology as the treated children, and paired and matched for sex and age, made up the controls. Measurements were obtained from cephalometric headfilms. Matched-intrapairs analysis of control versus treatment changes after 1 year of treatment was done. This showed that the treatment resulted in inhibited sagittal growth of the maxilla, increased anterior face height and a flattened soft tissue profile with a less protrusive upper lip and a less pronounced sulcus mentolabialis. The overjet decreased by 5 mm on average. Only slight retroclination of the upper incisors without extrusion and retroclination of lower incisors to the mandibular plane occurred. No significant anterior positioning of the mandible as compared with the controls was recorded in this study.  
21418667	Bulimia nervosa.	BMJ clinical evidence	2010	dev	14	6	1	Bulimia nervosa.  INTRODUCTION: Up to 1% of young women may have bulimia nervosa, characterised by an intense preoccupation with body weight, uncontrolled binge-eating episodes, and use of extreme measures to counteract the feared effects of overeating. People with bulimia nervosa may be of normal weight, making it difficult to diagnose. After 10 years, about half of people with bulimia nervosa will have recovered fully, one third will have made a partial recovery, and 10% to 20% will still have symptoms. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for bulimia nervosa in adults? What are the effects of discontinuing treatment in people with bulimia nervosa in remission? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 27 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; alone or plus exposure/response prevention enhancement), cognitive orientation therapy, dialectical behavioural therapy, discontinuing fluoxetine in people with remission, guided self-help cognitive behavioural therapy, hypnobehavioural therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, mirtazapine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), motivational enhancement therapy, pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, pure or unguided self-help cognitive behavioural therapy, reboxetine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), topiramate, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and venlafaxine.  
9746643	What's New in the Treatment of Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia?	Medscape women's health	1996	dev	13	23	10	"What's New in the Treatment of Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia?  The 3 eating disorders--anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating--occur at a frequency far greater than usually realized. Anorexia has been found to be present in up to 1% of teenage and young adult women, whereas estimates of bulimia have ranged up to 5%. The prevalence of binge-eating disorder is not known, but may be higher than bulimia. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by weight loss, body image disturbance, and a morbid fear of weight gain. Bulimia nervosa is characterized by binge eating and compensatory purging by vomiting; use of laxatives, diuretics, or diet pills; exercise; or fasting. Binge-eating disorder is characterized by binge behavior and loss of control of food intake, with an absence of purging. Eating disorders create significant mortality and morbidity. Medical complications associated with anorexia are those related to malnutrition and semistarvation. Medical complications associated with bulimia are those related to electrolyte imbalance and the physical effects of vomiting. The mortality rate of eating disorders may be as high as 15%, including deaths from arrhythmia, gastric hemorrhaging, and suicide. The core struggle within women with anorexia is the ""2 Ps"": feeling powerless and striving towards perfectionism. The core conflict within a bulimic person appears to be the ""2 Ds"": deprivation and dependency. The treatment of eating disorders includes psychotherapy, and, frequently, psychopharmacologic intervention. The psychotherapy primarily addresses issues of chaotic eating, hunger, inadequate caloric intake, conditioned response, and profound fear of expressing impulses and feelings, especially those of anger and sadness. Antidepressants, especially serotonergic agents, have been found to be useful, particularly in the treatment of bulimia.  "
33554873	Binge-Eating Disorder and Type 2 Diabetes: A Review.	Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists	2021	dev	6	23	3	Binge-Eating Disorder and Type 2 Diabetes: A Review.  OBJECTIVE: To familiarize health care providers with diagnosis and treatment of binge-eating disorder (BED), a common comorbidity of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). METHODS: Literature review of binge eating and T2DM. Key words used in search include BED, T2DM, obesity, and treatment. RESULTS: The prevalence of BED in patients with T2DM appears to be much higher than the 2% to 3.5% prevalence seen in the general population. Studies suggest that up to 20% of patients with T2DM have an underlying eating disorder, the most common of which is binge eating. BED is probably underdiagnosed, even though there are multiple simple tools that providers can use to improve screening for the disorder. Though the relationship between BED and hemoglobin A1c control can vary, it appears that binge-eating behaviors can worsen metabolic markers, including glycemic control. Various medications used by patients with diabetes have been associated with new-onset BED, and treatment may be as simple as removing or replacing such agents. Several medications have been found to significantly reduce binge-eating frequency, and potentially, weight. Patients with BED generally benefit from psychotherapy, including cognitive behavioral therapy. CONCLUSION: BED, only recently added to the International Classification of Disease-10 diagnostic list, is very common in patients with obesity and T2DM. The diagnosis is important to establish, as treatment or referral for treatment, could potentially improve many of the comorbidities and metrics of T2DM.  
3554306	Therapy for sleep disorders in depressives.	Psychopathology	1986	dev	7	12	2	Therapy for sleep disorders in depressives.  The treatment of sleep disorders in depressives depends basically on the nature of the underlying affective disorder (endogenous, organic, psychogenic or constitutional depression). Therapeutic approaches may be categorized in: psychological, somatic and pharmacological ones. The former include psychotherapies and behavioral treatments which are useful in psychogenic and constitutional depressions with sleep-onset insomnia but may also be supportive in endogenous depressions. The basic therapeutic factor common to all is anxiety reduction. Somatic therapies, such as ECT, total, partial and REM-sleep deprivation, sleep schedule shifts and bright light (EL) are utilized mostly in endogenous depressions. Sleep laboratory findings and different hypotheses concerning the mode of action of these alternative treatment methods are reviewed. Somnopolygraphic, psychometric, and neuroendocrinological data of our comparative trial with BL and partial sleep deprivation in normals and patients are discussed. The similarity of changes after BL, antidepressants and lithium points to a chronobiological factor in the pathogenesis and treatment of affective disorders. Electrosleep is still controversial, hydro-, ergo- and physical therapy are supportive therapies and as such indicated in all depressions. Exercise, fatigue and nutritional factors may influence sleep. Psychopharmacological treatment has to be regarded as the most important therapeutic approach for sleep disorders in depressives. Antidepressants are the drugs of choice for most patients. Based on their effects on sleep-induction, -maintenance, and -architecture and REM measures, one may differentiate at least two subtypes: sedative antidepressants of the amitriptyline type and nonsedative antidepressants of the desipramine type. Bedtime infusions of antidepressants may have sleep promoting properties, which was objectivated by an EEG spectral analysis during infusion and subsequently by all night sleep studies. Measures indicative of therapeutic outcome are still controversial. Tranquilizers, hypnotics, neuroleptics and serotonin precursors are utilized if the antidepressants alone do not ameliorate insomnia. However, as evidence of a shared diathesis of origin of depressive and anxiety disorders is building up, benzodiazepines are increasingly prescribed as monotherapy too. Finally, sleep laboratory data concerning the hypnotic properties of a pharmacological 80 mg doses of melatonin are demonstrated.  
19458081	Sexually harassing behavior against adolescent girls in rural Bangladesh: implications for achieving millennium development goals.	Journal of interpersonal violence	2010	dev	11	0	0	Sexually harassing behavior against adolescent girls in rural Bangladesh: implications for achieving millennium development goals.  This study examines the extent and type of sexually harassing behavior or intimidations unmarried adolescent girls experienced on their way to school, college or social visits and type of perpetrators in victims' view in rural Bangladesh using data of the 2004 National Nutrition Programme baseline survey. The survey collected self-reported data on sexual harassments of 5,106 girls aged 13-19 years selected randomly. Results reveal that gendered harassments were experienced by 35% of the girls, unwanted sexual attentions by 34%, and sexual intimidations by 14%, yielding prevalence of sexual harassments of any type 43%. Higher girls' education and household economic status heightened their risks of being harassed. Perpetrators were male young spoilt bullies (64%), neighborhood youths (30%), students (22%) and hoodlums (6%). High prevalence of sexual harassments mirrors vulnerability of adolescent girls in the community and deserves to be tackled to achieve millennium development goals (MDGs) in gender equality in health and social development.  
8378672	Effects of altitude on mood, behaviour and cognitive functioning. A review.	Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)	1993	dev	8	0	0	Effects of altitude on mood, behaviour and cognitive functioning. A review.  Alterations in psychological mood, personality, behaviour and cognitive functioning associated with altitude have been recognised for many years. Psychological and behavioural changes resulting from the effects of hypoxia often include increases in euphoria, irritability, hostility and impairment of neuropsychological functions such as vision and memory. There is limited research to indicate that some decrements may persist for up to a year, or longer, after return to lower elevation. However, generalisations of the effects of altitude on mood, behaviour and cognitive function are complicated by differences between studies including the specific tasks or dimensions measured, methods of measurement, degree of altitude, duration of exposure and types of participants. There also appear to be wide individual differences in the response to altitude sojourns. Investigations designed to measure symptoms and mood changes during actual mountain climbs are needed, since most of the systematic research has been conducted in altitude chambers. The extent to which these simulations can be generalised to actual altitude settings remains to be documented.  
22200244	Treatment with methotrexate of a cornual pregnancy following endometrial resection.	The European journal of contraception & reproductive health care : the official journal of the European Society of Contraception	2012	dev	2	3	0	Treatment with methotrexate of a cornual pregnancy following endometrial resection.  OBJECTIVES: Endometrial resection is a procedure often performed for treatment of menorrhagia. Despite the fact that amenorrhoea frequently ensues, some normal endometrium can remain present and become the implantation site of a pregnancy. Such an event is uncommon (0.7%); however, the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy is increased. This case report calls the reader's attention to the risk of intra- and extrauterine pregnancies and the necessity for contraception after endometrial resection, even in cases where amenorrhoea supervenes. CASE: A 46-year-old woman with prior endometrial resection and subsequent amenorrhoea, was diagnosed with a cornual pregnancy. She was successfully treated with systemic methotrexate, which was given in an outpatient clinic. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of the increased likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy after endometrial resection. All women submitting to this procedure should be counselled about the need for contraception, even in cases where amenorrhoea develops.  
22263494	[Analysis of influencing factors of Trichuris trichiura infection in demonstration plots of comprehensive control of parasitic diseases].	Zhongguo xue xi chong bing fang zhi za zhi = Chinese journal of schistosomiasis control	2011	dev	30	10	33	[Analysis of influencing factors of Trichuris trichiura infection in demonstration plots of comprehensive control of parasitic diseases].  OBJECTIVE: To understand the main risk factors of Trichuris trichiura infection in plots carrying out the integrated control of parasitic diseases. METHODS: The simple and multiple unconditional logistic regression were applied to analyze related data from the database of baseline survey in demonstration plots carrying out the integrated control of parasitic diseases. RESULTS: The results of simple logistic regression analysis suggested that the effects of 7 factors to Trichuris trichiura infection were significant (all P values were less than 0.05), namely drinking water resources, toilet type, fertilization type of farmland, fertilization type of vegetable field, washing hands after defecation, eating raw vegetables, melons and fruits and taking anthelminthic before examination. Among the factors above, eating raw vegetables, melons and fruits was of high risk (OR = 2.302), washing hands after defecation and taking anthelminthic before examination were two protection factors (with OR of 0.904 and 0.664, respectively). Compared to feces of human and livestock, fertilizing chemical fertilizer and compound fertilizer in farmland and vegetable field showed more obvious protection effect (with OR of 0.864 and 0.854, respectively). Drinking well water and spring water were two protection factors (with OR of 0.843 and 0.567, respectively). Simple toilet indoor and biogas pool also showed protection effect (with OR of 0.576 and 0.687, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that four factors including eating raw vegetables, melons and fruits, fertilization type of farmland, fertilization type of vegetable field and taking anthelminthic before examination were determined to be the main influencing factors of Trichuris trichiura infection. CONCLUSIONS: The main influencing factors of Trichuris trichiura infection in demonstration plots for the integrated control of parasitic diseases include eating raw vegetables, melons and fruits and fertilization type of farmland and vegetable field. Besides those, taking anthelminthic could reduce Trichuris trichiura infection of the population, meanwhile, sanitary water supply and latrine improvement could also reduce the risk of infection.  
19155779	Health behaviour patterns in relation to hypertension: the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing.	Journal of hypertension	2009	dev	17	9	0	Health behaviour patterns in relation to hypertension: the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing.  OBJECTIVE: Clinical guidelines emphasize that hypertensive individuals should be encouraged to maintain healthy lifestyles with respect to smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption and diet. We assessed health behaviours in a large sample of older hypertensive individuals, and tested whether medication for hypertension leads to compensatory increases in cardiovascular risk behaviours. METHODS: Analysis of wave 1 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, involving 5231 men and 6292 women aged at least 50 years. We analysed the prevalence of smoking, heavy drinking, sedentary behaviour and vigorous physical activity in relation to self-reported hypertension, controlling for age, sex, socioeconomic status, comorbidity (coronary heart disease, diabetes, arthritis), impairments of mobility, activities of daily living and depression. RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported hypertension was 37.8%, and 77% of hypertensive participants were prescribed medication. Hypertensive participants were less likely to smoke than normotensive ones (14.8 vs. 19.7%), with reduced odds of smoking [odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.56-0.83] after adjusting for covariates. Hypertensive individuals were more likely to be heavy drinkers (OR 1.34, CI 1.10-1.62), to be sedentary (OR 1.14, CI 1.02-1.27), and not engage in vigorous physical activity (OR 0.84, CI 0.75-0.94). There was no evidence for risk compensation in medicated hypertensive individuals compared with unmedicated ones. CONCLUSION: Smoking rates are low among hypertensive individuals, but the patterns of alcohol consumption and physical activity are suboptimal. Compensatory increases in risky behaviours appear not to be present in medicated individuals. There is considerable scope for advice and counselling to older hypertensive individuals to improve patterns of health behaviour.  
27909457	The Severity of Sleep Disordered Breathing Induces Different Decrease in the Oxygen Saturation During Rapid Eye Movement and Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep.	Psychiatry investigation	2016	dev	20	11	0	The Severity of Sleep Disordered Breathing Induces Different Decrease in the Oxygen Saturation During Rapid Eye Movement and Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep.  OBJECTIVE: To investigate how differences in oxygen saturation between non-REM (NREM) and REM sleep in patients according to the severity of sleep apnea. METHODS: We studied 396 male patients diagnosed with simple snoring or obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) on nocturnal polysomnography. Patients were divided into groups by the OSAS severity. We compared the average oxygen saturation between REM and NREM sleep in each group. RESULTS: In the simple snoring group, average oxygen saturation was significantly greater during REM than during NREM sleep. In the severe OSA group alone, average oxygen saturation was greater in NREM than in REM sleep. The difference of NREM-REM average oxygen saturation correlated significantly with AHI in the severe OSA group. CONCLUSION: More severe hypoxemia was seen in REM than NREM sleep in the severe OSAS group. The differential oxygen decrease between REM and NREM sleep is likely due to the differentially occurring sleep breathing events in each sleep stage according to the SDB severity. The more AHI increases in the severe OSAS patients, the more prominent the hypoxemia of REM sleep compared with NREM sleep is likely to appear. This suggests that the pressure of continuous positive airway pressure should be increased to control the hypoxemia of REM sleep in extremely severe OSAS.  
30021618	Cannabis for pediatric epilepsy: protocol for a living systematic review.	Systematic reviews	2018	dev	7	10	0	Cannabis for pediatric epilepsy: protocol for a living systematic review.  BACKGROUND: Pediatric epilepsy, including treatment-resistant forms, has a major effect on the quality of life, morbidity, and mortality of affected children. Interest has been growing in the use of medical cannabis as a treatment for pediatric epilepsy, yet there has been no comprehensive review of the benefits and harms of cannabis use in this population. In this systematic review, we will search for, synthesize, and assess the published and gray literature in order to provide usable and relevant information to parents, clinicians, and policy makers. METHODS: We will perform a living systematic review of studies involving the use of cannabis to treat pediatric epilepsy. We will search the published and gray literature for studies involving children with any type of epilepsy taking any form of cannabis. Studies will be selected for inclusion by two independent reviewers. The primary outcome is seizure freedom. Secondary outcomes are seizure frequency, quality of life (child, caregiver), quality and quantity of sleep, status epilepticus, tonic-clonic seizures, death (all-cause, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy), gastrointestinal adverse events (diarrhea, vomiting), and visits to the emergency room. The quality of each included study will be assessed. If data are sufficient in quantity and sufficiently similar, we will conduct pairwise random-effects meta-analysis. We will repeat the literature search every 6 months to identify studies published after the previous search date. Sequential meta-analysis will be performed as necessary to update the review findings. DISCUSSION: Our review aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date summary of the available evidence to inform decisions about the use of cannabis in children with treatment-resistant epilepsy. The results of this review will be of use to parents, clinicians, and policy makers as they navigate this rapidly evolving area. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42018084755.  
19856234	The efficacy of evidence-based psychotherapies versus usual care for youths: controlling confounds in a meta-reanalysis.	Psychotherapy research : journal of the Society for Psychotherapy Research	2010	dev	11	0	0	The efficacy of evidence-based psychotherapies versus usual care for youths: controlling confounds in a meta-reanalysis.  In the present meta-analysis, the authors examined how several confounding moderator variables may relate to the advantage of evidence-based psychological treatments (EBTs) over usual care (UC) in the treatment of youths, including the extent to which each therapy was bona fide, supervision provided to therapists, therapist caseload, whether EBT was provided by research therapists, and whether specialized training was provided for EBT therapists. When comparing EBT with bona fide UC while controlling for each confound individually, the advantage for EBT was small and nearly always statistically nonsignificant. Additionally, an increasing total number of confounds favoring EBT was significantly predictive of a greater effect size advantage for EBT. The superior efficacy of EBTs for youths may be an artifact of confounded research designs.  
26905587	Pancreatic cancer: associations of inflammatory potential of diet, cigarette smoking and long-standing diabetes.	Carcinogenesis	2016	dev	20	17	9	Pancreatic cancer: associations of inflammatory potential of diet, cigarette smoking and long-standing diabetes.  Epidemiologic studies show strong associations between pancreatic cancer (PC) and inflammatory stimuli or conditions such as cigarette smoking and diabetes, suggesting that inflammation may play a key role in PC. Studies of dietary patterns and cancer outcomes also suggest that diet might influence an individual's risk of PC by modulating inflammation. We therefore examined independent and joint associations between inflammatory potential of diet, cigarette smoking and long-standing (>=5 years) type II diabetes in relation to risk of PC. Analyses included data from 817 cases and 1756 controls. Inflammatory potential of diet was measured using the dietary inflammatory index (DII), calculated from dietary intake assessed via a 144-item food frequency questionnaire, and adjusted for energy intake. Information on smoking and diabetes were obtained via risk factor questionnaires. Associations were examined using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. Higher DII scores, reflecting a more proinflammatory diet, were associated with increased risk of PC [odds ratio (OR)Quintile 5 versus 1 = 2.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.87-3.46, P trend < 0.0001]. Excess risk of PC also was observed among former (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.07-1.54) and current (OR = 3.40, 95% CI = 2.28-5.07) smokers compared with never smokers, and among participants with long-standing diabetes (OR = 3.09, 95% CI = 2.02-4.72) compared with nondiabetics. Joint associations were observed for the combined effects of having greater than median DII score, and being a current smoker (OR = 4.79, 95% CI = 3.00-7.65) or having long-standing diabetes (OR = 6.03, 95% CI = 3.41-10.85). These findings suggest that a proinflammatory diet may act as cofactor with cigarette smoking and diabetes to increase risk of PC beyond the risk of any of these factors alone.  
24441294	Tobacco smoking, epilepsy, and seizures.	Epilepsy & behavior : E&B	2014	dev	18	16	8	Tobacco smoking, epilepsy, and seizures.  Tobacco smoking is considered the greatest risk factor for death caused by noncommunicable diseases. In contrast to extensive research on the association between tobacco smoking and diseases such as heart attack, stroke, and cancers, studies on the association between tobacco smoking and seizures or epilepsy are insufficient. The exact roles tobacco smoking and nicotine use play in seizures or epilepsy have not been well reviewed. We reviewed available literature and found that 1) there are vast differences between tobacco smoke and nicotine based on their components and their effects on seizures or epilepsy; 2) the seizure risk in acute active tobacco smokers, women who smoke during pregnancy, electronic cigarette smokers, and the role of smoking in sudden unexplained/unexpected death in epilepsy remain unclear; 3) seizure risks are higher in acute secondhand smokers, chronic active smokers, and babies whose mothers smoke; 4) tobacco smoke protects against seizures in animal models whereas nicotine exerts mixed effects in animals; and 5) tobacco smoking agents can be noneffective, proconvulsant, or anticonvulsant. Finally, the opportunities for future research on this topic is discussed.  
23178321	Development and initial validation of the White Bear Suppression Inventory (Smoking Version).	Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco	2013	dev	6	1	0	Development and initial validation of the White Bear Suppression Inventory (Smoking Version).  INTRODUCTION: Thought suppression can produce a paradoxical rebound in unwanted cognition. Although interest in the role of suppression in nicotine dependence is growing quickly, a validated measure specifically assessing suppression of smoking-related thoughts does not exist. The present study describes the development of the White Bear Suppression Inventory-Smoking Version (WBSI-S). METHOD: The WBSI-S, in vivo monitoring of avoidance, and several other measures were completed as a part of a larger study on smoking cessation. Participants (N = 172) completed measures either during (n = 83) or preceding a smoking cessation attempt. RESULTS: Factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure for the WBSI-S, which was consistent across experimental groups. Both the Intrusive Smoking-related Thoughts and Thought Suppression subscales showed strong internal consistency. The Suppression subscale showed good convergent and discriminant validity; the Intrusion subscale demonstrated equivocal discrimination from other constructs. Participants completing the measure during a quit attempt reported higher self-reported suppression of thoughts about smoking than did continuing smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, results support the construct validity of the suppression subscale and emphasize the importance of assessing suppression independently from intrusion.  
15572544	Alveolar antioxidant status in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.	The European respiratory journal	2004	dev	0	10	0	Alveolar antioxidant status in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.  In the acutely inflamed lung, oxidant stress occurs within the alveolar compartment. Under these conditions, the regulation of low molecular weight antioxidants in the epithelial lining fluid is poorly understood. Therefore, antioxidant levels were measured in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; n=40) and in healthy volunteers (n=20). Reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidised glutathione (GSSG; enzymatic assay), retinol (vitamin A), alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), uric acid (all by HPLC), plasmalogens (1-alkenyl-2-acyl phospholipids), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; both by gas-liquid chromatography), and F2-isoprostanes (ELISA) were quantified. All values are expressed as concentrations in cell-depleted BALF. GSSG (ARDS: 0.13+/-0.02 microM; control: 0.03+/-0.01 microM; mean+/-sem) and F2-isoprostanes (ARDS: 78+/-10 pM; control: 26+/-5 pM) were increased in ARDS, thus indicating oxidant stress. GSH levels in patients did not change significantly, whereas concentrations of vitamins A and C, vitamin E (ARDS: 77+/-15 nM; control: 26+/-3 nM) and uric acid (ARDS: 11.8+/-2.2 microM; control: 0.7+/-0.0 microM) were significantly elevated in ARDS. PUFA of total lipids, which may act as sacrificial antioxidants, increased by a factor of approximately 3 in patients, but plasmalogens showed a significant decrease. In conclusion, low molecular weight antioxidants are elevated in the alveolar compartment of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Further research is warranted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this finding.  
27406317	Effects of salicylic acid-induced wine rich in anthocyanins on metabolic parameters and adipose insulin signaling in high-fructose fed rats.	International journal of food sciences and nutrition	2016	dev	24	3	3	Effects of salicylic acid-induced wine rich in anthocyanins on metabolic parameters and adipose insulin signaling in high-fructose fed rats.  We evaluated the effects of Syrah red wine treated with salicylic acid (RW SA) and its control red wine (RW) on metabolic parameters, systolic blood pressure and adipose tissue insulin signaling in high-fructose (F) fed rats. Grape treated with SA increased the anthocyanin (ANTs) levels in RW. F induced increased systolic blood pressure, dislipidemia and insulin resistance (HOMA:IR). F rats treated with RW significantly prevented these alterations while RW SA partially attenuated triglycerides levels and HOMA:IR without modifications in HDL cholesterol levels. F impaired the adipose tissue response to insulin. Supplementation with RW and RW SA partially attenuated these alterations. Rats supplemented with RW SA had lesser beneficial effects on metabolic alterations than control RW, while both RW and RW SA attenuated altered adipose response to insulin. More studies are necessary to deeply evaluate the effect on SA-induced RW rich in ANTs levels on metabolic alterations associated to MetS.  
26841139	Climatic Factors and Epidemiologic Characteristics of Head and Neck Skin Malignancies in Osijek Baranja County, Croatia.	Central European journal of public health	2015	dev	11	16	2	Climatic Factors and Epidemiologic Characteristics of Head and Neck Skin Malignancies in Osijek Baranja County, Croatia.  AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the incidence and epidemiological characteristics of head and/or neck skin malignancies in Osijek-Baranja County, Croatia, and to connect them with relative climatic indicators such as the number and intensity of sunny and cloudy days over a longer period of time. METHODS: The study included patients from Osijek Baranja County with confirmed pathohistological diagnosis of the head and/or neck malignancies from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2012. The patients were analyzed according to gender, age, residence, occupation, type and location of the neoplasm, and hair and eye colour. The analysis of climatic elements (mean monthly and annual cloudiness values, mean monthly and annual sum values of sunny days) for a period of 50 years (1961-2011) based on the data of the Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service for the investigated area was performed. RESULTS: The study included a total of 2,952 patients: 1,487 (50.4%) males and 1,465 (49.6%) females, representing the estimated annual incidence of 104/100,000. The mean age was 72 years. The patients were mostly from rural areas, 1,952 (66.2%); 2,137 (72.4%) worked outdoors: 907 farmers (42.4%) and 889 construction workers (41.6%). Given the type of neoplasm, the most common was a basal cell cancer (BCC) in 2,160 patients (73.2%). Malignant melanoma was found in 93 patients (3.1%). The most common localizations were face (839 cases, 28.7%) and nose (643 cases, 22.0%). Males had a significantly higher number of planocellular malignancies--341 (56.6%) than females--262 (43.4%) (p=0.005). The median age of the patients was 67 years. There were no significant differences in types of malignancies, place of residence, workplace, or occupation (with respect to working outdoors or indoors). It has been shown that the ears and lips are significantly more affected by squamous cell malignancies (p=0.039 and p<0.001) compared to the neck, eye and head with malignant melanoma (p=0.004, p<0.001, and p=0.026) and the nose where basal cell neoplasms (p=0.002) prevail. There were no significant differences in the type and frequency of malignant neoplasms in relation to hair and eye colour of the patients. The last 50 years in Osijek-Baranja County have seen a declining trend in the number of cloudy days and upward trend in the mean annual sum of sunny days. When compared, the increase in sunny days results in a higher number of patients suffering from malignant melanoma (rho=0.695, p=0.038). CONCLUSION: It is obvious that malignant neoplasms of the skin, head and neck occur after decades of exposure, and as a cumulative effect of exposure to risk factors. A direct exposure to sun seems to play an important role, especially with regard to melanoma. Nevertheless, further research is needed.  
21340493	Postdiagnosis diet quality, the combination of diet quality and recreational physical activity, and prognosis after early-stage breast cancer.	Cancer causes & control : CCC	2011	dev	15	9	6	Postdiagnosis diet quality, the combination of diet quality and recreational physical activity, and prognosis after early-stage breast cancer.  OBJECTIVE: To investigate, among women with breast cancer, how postdiagnosis diet quality and the combination of diet quality and recreational physical activity are associated with prognosis. METHODS: This multiethnic, prospective observational cohort included 670 women diagnosed with local or regional breast cancer. Thirty months after diagnosis, women completed self-report assessments on diet and physical activity and were followed for 6 years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals for death from any cause and breast cancer death. RESULTS: Women consuming better-quality diets, as defined by higher Healthy Eating Index-2005 scores, had a 60% reduced risk of death from any cause (HR(Q4:Q1): 0.40, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.94) and an 88% reduced risk of death from breast cancer (HR(Q4:Q1): 0.12, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.99). Compared with inactive survivors consuming poor-quality diets, survivors engaging in any recreational physical activity and consuming better-quality diets had an 89% reduced risk of death from any cause (HR: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.36) and a 91% reduced risk of death from breast cancer (HR: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.89). Associations observed were independent of obesity status. CONCLUSION: Women diagnosed with localized or regional breast cancer may improve prognosis by adopting better-quality dietary patterns and regular recreational physical activity. Lifestyle interventions emphasizing postdiagnosis behavior changes are advisable in breast cancer survivors.  
24719722	Relationship between dietary patterns and dental health in type I diabetic children compared with healthy controls.	Iranian Red Crescent medical journal	2014	dev	22	9	6	Relationship between dietary patterns and dental health in type I diabetic children compared with healthy controls.  BACKGROUND: Dietary habits are established in childhood and will persist until adulthood, being one of the human health pillars. Many diseases of humans have roots in the individuals' diet, of which dental caries are one of the common infectious diseases. Diabetes Mellitus is also considered as the most common metabolic disorder in children. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the dietary patterns of children with type I Diabetes Mellitus with that of non-diabetic children, in relation to dental caries. MATERIALS/PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, 31 patients (13 boys and 18 girls, mean age of 11 +/- 5.4 years) with type I Diabetes Mellitus referred to the Diabetes Mellitus Center and university hospitals were selected. Controls were 31 healthy students matched for age and sex. The study was based on the data obtained from the questionnaire containing information about dietary patterns and oral hygiene habits, social class and decayed/missing/filled teeth (DMFT) index. Dietary patterns were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire developed on the basis of caries preventing or inducing foods and then scored. Data were analyzed by using the t-test and McNamara's test. RESULTS: Diabetic children had less frequent cariogenic snacks than their controls. The mean diet scores for diabetic and healthy subjects were 7.65 +/- 3.27 and 11.9 +/- 2.03 (P < 0.05), respectively. There was no significant difference in DMFT between the diabetics and controls (3.71 +/- 2.48 vs. 4.35 +/- 2.74, respectively). There were also no differences in frequency of tooth brushing and use of mouth washes. However, more diabetics reported that they have never used dental floss compared to controls (42.2% vs. 71%, P < 0.05). Having cheese with bread as snack was more prevalent in diabetics (P < 0.05).There was a positive correlation between DMFT and dietary scores (r = 0.3, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Controls scored higher in their dietary habits and dental flossing but lower in tooth brushing and mouth washing. More diabetics tend to have snacks like cheese and bread, which is a caries-preventing habit.  
12936919	Associations of whole-grain, refined-grain, and fruit and vegetable consumption with risks of all-cause mortality and incident coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.	The American journal of clinical nutrition	2003	dev	28	16	14	Associations of whole-grain, refined-grain, and fruit and vegetable consumption with risks of all-cause mortality and incident coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.  BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiologic study results showed that subjects who had high intakes of whole-grain foods had lower risks of death and heart disease than did subjects who had low intakes. However, the findings were inconsistent for fruit and vegetable intake. OBJECTIVE: The relations of whole-grain, refined-grain, and fruit and vegetable intakes with the risk of total mortality and the incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic stroke were studied in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort (baseline: age 45-64 y, n = 15,792). DESIGN: Proportional hazards regression analyses were used to assess the relations of whole-grain, refined-grain, and fruit and vegetable intakes with the risk of death and the incidence of CAD and ischemic stroke, with adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, energy intake, and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dietary intakes were assessed by using a food-frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Over an 11-y follow-up period, whole-grain intake was inversely associated with total mortality and incident CAD. The relative hazards of death for quintiles 2-5 of fruit and vegetable intake were 1.08 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.33), 0.94 (0.75, 1.17), 0.87 (0.68, 1.10), and 0.78 (0.61, 1.01), respectively; P for trend = 0.02. An inverse association between fruit and vegetable intake and CAD was observed among African Americans but not among whites (P for interaction = 0.01). The risk of ischemic stroke was not significantly related to whole-grain, refined-grain, or fruit and vegetable consumption. CONCLUSION: These observational findings suggest a beneficial effect of whole-grain and fruit and vegetable consumption on the risks of total mortality and incident CAD but not on the risk of ischemic stroke.  
903993	Associations of cancer site and type with occupation and industry from the Third National Cancer Survey Interview.	Journal of the National Cancer Institute	1977	dev	8	12	0	Associations of cancer site and type with occupation and industry from the Third National Cancer Survey Interview.  From the Third National Cancer Survey (TNCS) Interview Study of 7,518 incident cases, lifetime histories of occupations and industries were studied for associations with specific cancer sites and types while controlling for age, sex, race, education, use of cigarettes or alcohol, and geographic location. Lung cancer patients were found more often than expected among several categories including trucking, air transportation, wholesaling, painting, building construction, building maintenance, and manufacturing (furniture, transportation equipment, and food products). Controlling for cigarette smoking did not change these associations. Leukemia and multiple myeloma were associated with sales personnel of both sexes, whereas lymphomas and Hodgkin's disease were excessive among women working in the medical industry. Other associations included rectal cancer with several retail industries; prostate cancer with ministers, farmers, plumbers, and coal miners; malignant melanoma with school teachers; and invasive cervical cancer with women working in hotels and restaurants. Breast cancer patients were more common among women who were teachers or other professionals and who worked in business and finance (even after controlling for education). Many other findings are presented in detailed tables. Results are reported mainly as a research resource for use by other investigators doing work in this field. Suggestions are given for future studies.  
16304318	Occupational asthma and occupational rhinitis in hairdressers.	Chest	2005	dev	9	14	8	Occupational asthma and occupational rhinitis in hairdressers.  BACKGROUND: Hairdressers are at risk for occupational respiratory diseases, but the risk factors, causal agents, and underlying mechanisms are not completely defined. AIM: To describe the features of a large group of hairdressers consecutively referred to our center for suspected occupational asthma (OA) over an 8-year period, the type of occupational respiratory diseases, the etiologic agents, and the diagnostic tests. RESULTS: Forty-seven hairdressers (mean age, 25 years; range, 17 to 52 years) were studied. On the basis of the response to the specific inhalation challenge (SIC), 24 patients received a diagnosis of OA (51.1%), which was due to persulfate salts in 21 patients (87.5%), permanent hair dyes in 2 patients (8.3%), and latex in 1 patient (4.2%). Thirteen of these 24 patients (54.2%) also received a diagnosis of occupational rhinitis, which was due to persulfate salts in 11 patients (84.6%) and to paraphenylenediamine in two patients (15.4%). Patients with persulfate asthma had a long period of exposure to bleaching agents, a long latent period between the start of exposure and the onset of symptoms, and a prevalent eosinophilic airway inflammation in induced sputum. The skin-prick test with ammonium persulfate performed in a subset of patients gave negative results CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we confirmed that persulfate salts are the major agents involved in OA and occupational rhinitis in hairdressers. The positive response to the SIC in only a part of the population of symptomatic exposed workers, the period between the starting of exposure and the onset of symptoms, the type of response to the SIC, and the high frequency of association of asthma with other diseases such as dermatitis and rhinitis suggest an immunologic mechanism that remains to be elucidated.  
20460552	Father's and mother's psychological violence and adolescent behavioral adjustment.	Journal of interpersonal violence	2011	dev	15	0	0	Father's and mother's psychological violence and adolescent behavioral adjustment.  Maternal and paternal psychological violence were examined as potential risk factors for internalized and externalized behavior problems displayed by adolescents. Childhood family violence (physical and psychological parental violence), current extrafamily violence (bullying and dating violence), and family structure were taken into account. A sample of 278 adolescents (mean age: 14.2) were recruited in three public schools located in low to high socioeconomic areas. Participants were in the 7th, 8th, and 9th grades, and each completed a self-administered questionnaire. Frequency of current psychological violence is about the same for each parental figure. The three most frequent and least frequent psychologically violent parental practices were also the same for both parental figures. Psychological violence of both parents was related to internalized and externalized behavior problems over and above family structure, childhood family violence, and current extrafamily violence.  
33527709	The impact of air pollution on skin and related disorders: A comprehensive review.	Dermatologic therapy	2021	dev	25	10	8	The impact of air pollution on skin and related disorders: A comprehensive review.  As the largest organ in the body, human skin is constantly exposed to harmful compounds existing in the surrounding environment as the first-line barrier. Studies have indicated that exposure to high concentrations of many environmental factors, such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation, outdoor air pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM), heavy metals, gaseous pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxides (NOx ), sulfur oxide (SO2 ), ozone (O3 ), and indoor air pollutants (solid fuels consumption), might interrupt the skin's normal barrier function. Besides, the intensity of the pollutants and the length of exposure might be a contributing factor. Air pollutants are believed to induce or exacerbate a range of skin conditions, such as aging, inflammatory diseases (atopic dermatitis, cellulitis, and psoriasis), acne, hair loss, and even skin cancers (mainly melanoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma) through various mechanisms. The interaction between pollutants and the skin might differ based on each agent's particular characteristics. Also, damaging the skin barrier seems to be closely related to the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), induction of oxidative stress, activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and inflammatory cytokines. This article reviews recent studies on the correlation between air pollutants and skin diseases, along with related mechanisms.  
22491891	Denicotinized versus average nicotine tobacco cigarette smoking differentially releases striatal dopamine.	Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco	2013	dev	20	0	0	Denicotinized versus average nicotine tobacco cigarette smoking differentially releases striatal dopamine.  INTRODUCTION: Nicotine has long been recognized as a necessary but insufficient component of tobacco cigarettes to maintain a psychophysiological need to smoke. This study examined venous plasma concentrations effects of nicotine in cigarette smoking after overnight abstinence to release striatal dopamine (DA). METHODS: Twenty-two male smokers smoked either denicotinized (denic) or average nicotine (nic) cigarettes under single blind conditions. Each was given [(11)C]raclopride and scanned in a positron emission tomography (PET) facility. RESULTS: Smoking either denic or nic cigarettes released striatal DA. Denic cigarette smoking released DA primarily in the right striatum, whereas nic cigarette smoking released DA in both striata, but especially in the left. Increases in venous plasma nicotine concentrations correlated positively with increased DA release in the left caudate nucleus. Smoking denic cigarettes reduced craving as much as smoking nic cigarettes. Craving reduction after nic tobacco smoking correlated with increases in plasma nicotine. CONCLUSIONS: Nonnicotine factors in tobacco smoking produce important right brain effects. Nicotine is a pharmacological factor during tobacco smoking that releases bilateral striatal DA, but more in the left brain.  
31610406	Sleep quality is related to brain glutamate and symptom severity in schizophrenia.	Journal of psychiatric research	2020	dev	11	8	4	Sleep quality is related to brain glutamate and symptom severity in schizophrenia.  Up to 80% of patients with schizophrenia experience sleep disturbances, which negatively impact daytime functioning. Given that the glutamatergic system is involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia as well as normal sleep-wake neurobiology, the current project aimed to determine whether sleep quality was related to brain glutamate levels in schizophrenia. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess subjective sleep quality and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to quantify glutamate in the bilateral anterior cingulate, left parietal cortex, and left hippocampus. Results indicate that global PSQI scores were negatively correlated with the anterior cingulate and parietal glutamate levels. In patients with schizophrenia, poorer sleep quality correlated with greater positive symptom severity. Our findings suggest that poor sleep quality is related to greater positive symptom severity and lower levels of anterior cingulate glutamate in individuals with schizophrenia. Interventions to enhance sleep quality may prove beneficial for patients. Future studies will examine whether glutamate relates to objective measures of sleep quality, and whether glutamate may mediate the relationship between sleep quality and symptom severity across the schizophrenia-spectrum.  
33435906	An acute gastroenteritis outbreak associated with breakfast contaminated with norovirus by asymptotic food handler at a kindergarten in Shenzhen, China.	BMC infectious diseases	2021	dev	9	6	0	An acute gastroenteritis outbreak associated with breakfast contaminated with norovirus by asymptotic food handler at a kindergarten in Shenzhen, China.  BACKGROUND: An outbreak of acute gastroenteritis occurred in a kindergarten located Shenzhen City on March 4, 2018. We were invited to investigate to the risk factors associated with this outbreak. METHODS: We conducted retrospective cohort-studies on three different groups of subjects in order to figure out the difference of incidence of acute gastroenteritis among subjects of different activities on March 2: group one consisted of people who attended the Lantern festival activities; group two consisted of children and employees who ate breakfast and bread provided by the kindergarten; and groups three consisted of children and employees who did not eat breakfast or bread provided by the kindergarten. Fecal, anal swabs, dishware swabs and hand swabs specimens were collected in the study. Bacteria known to cause acute gastroenteritis were cultured. Viruses associated with acute gastroenteritis were tested using real-time PCR. Capsid gene fragment of 557 bp of norovirus was amplified and sequenced. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA 7.0 using neighbor-joining method based on capsid gene fragment of norovirus. RESULTS: A total of 143 suspected cases were identified in this outbreak. Diarrhea happened more often in adults than in children while emesis and bellyache were more frequently found in children than in adults. Higher AGE incidence was observed in group 2, children and employees who had breakfast in the kindergarten on March 2, as well as in group 3, and among employees who eating bread involved in breakfast provided on March 2. Five anal swab specimens were positive for norovirus. All noroviruses belongs to group II.3 and have an identity more than 99%. CONCLUSION: A chef, as an asymptomatic carrier with norovirus, was the infectious resource in this outbreak. He contaminated breakfast food provided on March 2. Although morning check is implemented in kindergartens of China, employees are often excluded in morning check. Our finding highlights the importance of morning check covering employees and periodical training for cooks.  
31654913	Association of water fluoride and urinary fluoride concentrations with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in Canadian youth.	Environment international	2019	dev	15	9	5	Association of water fluoride and urinary fluoride concentrations with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in Canadian youth.  BACKGROUND: Exposure to fluoride has been linked with increased prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the United States and symptoms of inattention in Mexican children. We examined the association between fluoride exposure and attention outcomes among youth living in Canada. METHOD: We used cross-sectional data collected from youth 6 to 17 years of age from the Canadian Health Measures Survey (Cycles 2 and 3). Urinary fluoride concentration adjusted for specific gravity (UFSG) was available for 1877 participants. Water fluoride concentration measured in tap water samples was available for 980 participants. Community water fluoridation (CWF) status was determined by viewing reports on each city's website or contacting the water treatment plant. We used logistic regression to test the association between the three measures of fluoride exposure and ADHD diagnosis. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship between the three measures of fluoride exposure and the hyperactivity/inattention score on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). RESULTS: UFSG did not significantly predict ADHD diagnosis or hyperactive/inattentive symptoms. A 1 mg/L increase in tap water fluoride level was associated with a 6.1 times higher odds of an ADHD diagnosis (95% CI = 1.60, 22.8). A significant interaction between age and tap water fluoride level (p = .03) indicated a stronger association between tap water fluoride and hyperactivity/inattention symptoms among older youth. A 1 mg/L increase in water fluoride level was associated with a 1.5 SDQ score increase (95% CI: 0.23, 2.68, p = .02) for youth at the 75th percentile of age (14 years old). Similarly, there was a significant interaction between age and CWF. At the 75th percentile of age (14 years old), those living in a fluoridated region had a 0.7-point higher SDQ score (95% CI = 0.34, 1.06, p < .01) and the predicted odds of an ADHD diagnosis was 2.8 times greater compared with youth in a non-fluoridated region (aOR = 2.84, 95% CI: 1.40, 5.76, p < .01). DISCUSSION: Exposure to higher levels of fluoride in tap water is associated with an increased risk of ADHD symptoms and diagnosis of ADHD among Canadian youth, particularly among adolescents. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these results.  
18605129	Evaluating negative process: a comparison of working alliance, interpersonal behavior, and narrative coherency among three psychotherapy outcome conditions.	American journal of psychotherapy	2008	dev	5	0	0	Evaluating negative process: a comparison of working alliance, interpersonal behavior, and narrative coherency among three psychotherapy outcome conditions.  The aim of this study was to investigate the interrelationships of three measures of the therapeutic relationship and their validity in predicting treatment outcome, including the early identification of two treatment-failure conditions. Forty-eight patient-therapist dyads, in 30-session therapies for personality-disordered patients, were classified as premature dropout (DO), poor outcome (PO), or good outcome (GO) cases. Poor and Good Outcomes were determined by a reliable change score. Dropout cases were terminated during the first third of treatment, and patients cited dissatisfaction with the therapy or therapist. Assessment of working alliance, interpersonal behavior and a new measure of narrative coherency in the first third of treatment revealed that DO dyads had significantly poorer alliances and less coherent narratives in early sessions, while PO dyads, who ultimately completed the 30-session treatment protocol, unexpectedly demonstrated the highest degree of hostile complementarity. Clinical implications of the results are discussed.  
10541442	The influence of air travel on athletic performance.	Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)	1999	dev	8	0	0	The influence of air travel on athletic performance.  Rapid transmeridian flight is a common reality for modern athletes and it has often been assumed that air travel has detrimental effects on athletic performance. The plausibility of this assumption is supported by established deteriorations in sleep and mood following transmeridian flight. However, the scientific evidence supporting the assumption is neither consistent nor compelling. Studies that have assessed athletic performance following transmeridian flight have produced mixed results and are characterised by major methodological flaws. Recent retrospective assessments of athletic team performance based on distance travelled have generally failed to indicate performance impairments following transmeridian flight. The plausibility of transmeridian air travel impairing athletic performance would be indicated by demonstration of an internally-driven circadian rhythm of athletic performance, or of deleterious performance consequences following sleep deprivation or desynchronisation between the circadian system and the environment. More rigorous research is needed to establish whether athletic performance is influenced by air travel.  
17569221	Protection from acute and chronic lung diseases by curcumin.	Advances in experimental medicine and biology	2007	dev	15	12	14	Protection from acute and chronic lung diseases by curcumin.  The aim of this review has been to describe the current state of the therapeutic potential of curcumin in acute and chronic lung injuries. Occupational and environmental exposures to mineral dusts, airborne pollutants, cigarette smoke, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy injure the lungs, resulting in acute and chronic inflammatory lung diseases. Despite major advances in treating lung diseases, until now disease-modifying efficacy has not been demonstrated for any of the existing drugs. Current medical therapy offers only marginal benefit; therefore, there is an essential need to develop new drugs that might be of effective benefit in clinical settings. Over the years, there has been increasing evidence that curcumin, a phytochemical present in turmeric (Curcuma longa), has a wide spectrum of therapeutic properties and a remarkable range of protective effects in various diseases. Several experimental animal models have tested curcumin on lung fibrosis and these studies demonstrate that curcumin attenuates lung injury and fibrosis caused by radiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, and toxicants. The growing amount of data from pharmacological and animal studies also supports the notion that curcumin plays a protective role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and allergic asthma, its therapeutic action being on the prevention or modulation of inflammation and oxidative stress. These findings give substance to the possibility of testing curcumin in patients with lung diseases.  
32495021	Assessing Diabetes Distress and Sleep Quality in Young Adults with Type 1 Diabetes Using FreeStyle Libre: A Prospective Cohort Study.	Diabetes therapy : research, treatment and education of diabetes and related disorders	2020	dev	6	11	0	Assessing Diabetes Distress and Sleep Quality in Young Adults with Type 1 Diabetes Using FreeStyle Libre: A Prospective Cohort Study.  INTRODUCTION: The burden of diabetes, its potential complications, and related self-care activities can induce negative psychosocial effects in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). This prospective cohort study investigated the psychosocial benefits associated with 3 months of FreeStyle Libre (FSL) flash glucose monitoring use in young adults with T1DM in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Patients completed the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaires at baseline and 3 months. HbA1c, number of confirmed hypoglycemia episodes per month, and frequency of blood glucose testing were also collected at baseline and 3 months. RESULTS: Of 95 patients analyzed, significant reductions were observed in mean DDS (3.8 vs. 2.5; p < 0.001) and PSQI (8.7 vs. 3.9; p < 0.001) scores from baseline to 3 months. Furthermore, HbA1c and confirmed hypoglycemia episodes per month also decreased from baseline to 3 months (HbA1c 8.3 vs. 7.7% [67 vs. 61 mmol/mol], p < 0.001; hypoglycemia episodes 3.0 vs. 2.3, p < 0.001). In contrast, mean frequency of blood glucose testing per day increased from baseline to 3 months (2.5 vs. 5.2; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate improvements in diabetes distress and sleep quality as well as glycemic outcomes following 3 months' FSL use in young adults with T1DM.  
30980555	Airborne transmission between room occupants during short-term events: Measurement and evaluation.	Indoor air	2019	dev	2	0	0	Airborne transmission between room occupants during short-term events: Measurement and evaluation.  This study experimentally examines and compares the dynamics and short-term events of airborne cross-infection in a full-scale room ventilated by stratum, mixing and displacement air distributions. Two breathing thermal manikins were employed to simulate a standing infected person and a standing exposed person. Four influential factors were examined, including separation distance between manikins, air change per hour, positioning of the two manikinsand air distribution. Tracer gas technique was used to simulate the exhaled droplet nuclei from the infected person and fast tracer gas concentration meters (FCM41) were used to monitor the concentrations. Real-time and average exposure indices were proposed to evaluate the dynamics of airborne exposure. The time-averaged exposure index depends on the duration of exposure time and can be considerably different during short-term events and under steady-state conditions. The exposure risk during short-term events may not always decrease with increasing separation distance. It changes over time and may not always increase with time. These findings imply that the control measures formulated on the basis of steady-state conditions are not necessarily appropriate for short-term events.  
15298566	Sensitization to Ficus benjamina: relationship to natural rubber latex allergy and identification of foods implicated in the Ficus-fruit syndrome.	Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology	2004	dev	21	8	0	Sensitization to Ficus benjamina: relationship to natural rubber latex allergy and identification of foods implicated in the Ficus-fruit syndrome.  BACKGROUND: Ornamental Ficus benjamina (FB) has been recognized as a new indoor allergen. Little is known about the prevalence in moderately exposed subjects and the proposed association with fruit and Hevea latex hypersensitivity. OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of FB sensitization and the relationship with Hevea latex allergy, to identify cross-reacting fruits, and to characterize the responsible allergens. METHODS: A skin prick test solution prepared from FB latex (200 microg/mL) was included in our routine screening programme for suspect inhalant allergy. Patients reacting with the FB extract were further skin tested with exotic fruits by the prick-to-prick method. Inhibition of fig and FB CAP by FB latex, fig (Ficus carica), kiwi, the thiolproteases ficin and papain, Hevea latex and rHev b 6.02 (hevein) was performed in selected patients. RESULTS: Of 2662 patients with a positive skin test to any aeroallergen, 66 (2.5%) reacted with FB. Ten patients showed isolated sensitization to FB. Although FB-positive subjects were more often co-sensitized to Hevea latex than FB-negative (10.6% vs 3.8%, P< 0.01), nearly 90% tested negative for Hevea latex. Sensitization to FB was specifically associated with positive skin tests to fresh fig (83%), dried fig (37%), kiwi fruit (28%), papaya (22%), avocado (19%), banana (15%), and pineapple (10%) (n = 54). Clinical reactions were reported mainly from fresh and dried fig and kiwi (47%, 60%, and 64%, respectively, of skin test-positive patients), including seven patients with systemic reactions (urticaria, angiooedema, asthma). CAP to fig in 11 patients with clinical fruit allergy was inhibited on average by 87% by FB latex, 89% by fresh fig, 80% by dried fig, 38% by kiwi (100 microg/mL each), and by 59% and 44% by ficin and papain (50 microg/mL), respectively. No inhibition was obtained with Hevea latex and rHev b 6.02. CAP to FB was inhibited on average by 95% by FB, 60% by fresh fig, 41% by ficin, 29% by papain, and less than 7% by rubber latex allergens. CONCLUSIONS: Sensitization to FB latex is found in 2.5% of atopic individuals and mostly occurs independently of Hevea latex allergy. Sensitization is commonly associated with allergic reactions to figs and other tropical fruits ('Ficus-fruit syndrome'). This cross-reactivity is mediated at least in part by thiolproteases.  
28189153	Antivirulence Properties of Probiotics in Combating Microbial Pathogenesis.	Advances in applied microbiology	2017	dev	17	11	11	Antivirulence Properties of Probiotics in Combating Microbial Pathogenesis.  Probiotics are nonpathogenic microorganisms that confer a health benefit on the host when administered in adequate amounts. Ample evidence is documented to support the potential application of probiotics for the prevention and treatment of infections. Health benefits of probiotics include prevention of diarrhea, including antibiotic-associated diarrhea and traveler's diarrhea, atopic eczema, dental carries, colorectal cancers, and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The cumulative body of scientific evidence that demonstrates the beneficial effects of probiotics on health and disease prevention has made probiotics increasingly important as a part of human nutrition and led to a surge in the demand for probiotics in clinical applications and as functional foods. The ability of probiotics to promote health is attributed to the various beneficial effects exerted by these microorganisms on the host. These include lactose metabolism and food digestion, production of antimicrobial peptides and control of enteric infections, anticarcinogenic properties, immunologic enhancement, enhancement of short-chain fatty acid production, antiatherogenic and cholesterol-lowering attributes, regulatory role in allergy, protection against vaginal or urinary tract infections, increased nutritional value, maintenance of epithelial integrity and barrier, stimulation of repair mechanism in cells, and maintenance and reestablishment of well-balanced indigenous intestinal and respiratory microbial communities. Most of these attributes primarily focus on the effect of probiotic supplementation on the host. Hence, in most cases, it can be concluded that the ability of a probiotic to protect the host from infection is an indirect result of promoting overall health and well-being. However, probiotics also exert a direct effect on invading microorganisms. The direct modes of action resulting in the elimination of pathogens include inhibition of pathogen replication by producing antimicrobial substances like bacteriocins, competition for limiting resources in the host, antitoxin effect, inhibition of virulence, antiadhesive and antiinvasive effects, and competitive exclusion by competition for binding sites or stimulation of epithelial barrier function. Although much has been documented about the ability of probiotics to promote host health, there is limited discussion on the above mentioned effects of probiotics on pathogens. Being in an era of antibiotic resistance, a better understanding of this complex probiotic-pathogen interaction is critical for development of effective strategies to control infections. Therefore, this chapter will focus on the ability of probiotics to directly modulate the infectious nature of pathogens and the underlying mechanisms that mediate these effects.  
11709596	A randomized controlled trial to investigate brackets bonded with a hydrophilic primer.	Journal of orthodontics	2001	dev	0	0	0	A randomized controlled trial to investigate brackets bonded with a hydrophilic primer.  OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical failure rates of brackets bonded using a prototype hydrophilic primer, designed to be insensitive to moisture, with brackets bonded with a conventional primer. DESIGN: Single centre randomised controlled clinical study. Thirty-three patients were bonded using a split mouth technique: randomly allocating the hydrophilic primer to one side of the mouth and a conventional primer to the other. SETTING: Hospital orthodontic department, Bradford, UK. SUBJECTS: Orthodontic patients requiring fixed appliances. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The site and time to bond failure was recorded for each bracket that failed over 6 months. RESULTS: Using survival analysis, there was an increased risk of bracket failure when bonded with the hydrophilic primer compared with the conventional primer (hazard ratio = 2.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.1 to 4.5, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This hydrophilic primer cannot be recommended for routine clinical use.  
32963328	Secular trends in sedentary behaviors and associations with weight indicators among Chinese reproductive-age women from 2004 to 2015: findings from the China Health and Nutrition Survey.	International journal of obesity (2005)	2020	dev	46	11	12	Secular trends in sedentary behaviors and associations with weight indicators among Chinese reproductive-age women from 2004 to 2015: findings from the China Health and Nutrition Survey.  BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are rising among Chinese reproductive-age women, while some studies have focused on the relationship between sedentary behavior and obesity in certain populations, none has focused on Chinese reproductive-age women specifically. This study examined secular trends in leisure time sedentary behaviors (watching television time, computer time and reading time, and the total sedentary time) among Chinese reproductive-age women and the association of those behaviors with five weight indicators-body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and overweight, obesity, and abdominal obesity status. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted with Chinese reproductive-age women aged 15-49 who had participated in two or more rounds of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), and completed the questionnaire and anthropometric measurements. The exposure variables were the average weekly time spent on three leisure time sedentary behaviors (watching television, using computer, and reading) and the total sedentary time (the sum of the above three sedentary time and video game time). Mixed-effect linear models were produced to explore the secular trends of the mean hours of these sedentary behaviors and the total sedentary time after adjusting covariates. Models were also produced to study the effects of these types of sedentary behavior levels on BMI and WC. Mixed-effect logistic regression models were produced to study the effects of the sedentary behavior levels on overweight, obesity, and abdominal obesity status. RESULTS: The total sedentary time among the reproductive-age women increased over time across most of age, region, educational levels, and income groups from 2004 to 2015. Television hours fluctuated, it increased and then declined over time across most of age, region, and income groups. Computer hours continually increased over time across all age, region, educational level, and income groups. Reading hours gradually decreased over time across most of age, region, educational level, and income groups. Those with a moderate level of television time (14 to <35 h/week) had 1.08 cm larger WCs and were 1.31 times more likely to have abdominal obesity than those with a low level of television time (<14 h/week). Those with a high level of television time (>=35 h/week) had 1.74 cm larger WCs, 0.66 kg/m(2) larger BMIs, were 1.50 times more likely to be overweight and were 1.47 times more likely to have abdominal obesity than those with a low level of television time (<14 h/week). Greater computer, reading time, and total sedentary time were not associated with WC, BMI, overweight, obesity, or abdominal obesity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings showed that among Chinese reproductive-age women ages 15-49, secular trends of computer time increased rapidly, reading time decreased gradually and television time fluctuated but showed not much difference from 2004 to 2015. The sharp increase in computer time far outweighed the decline in reading time. As a result, the overall sedentary behavior time of Chinese reproductive-age women gradually increased. These findings provided strong evidence that greater television time was significantly associated with higher BMI, WC, and higher risks of overweight, abdominal obesity among Chinese reproductive-age women. Computer, reading, and the total sedentary time were not associated with those weight indicators.  
10389102	Genetic factors in human sleep disorders with special reference to Norrie disease, Prader-Willi syndrome and Moebius syndrome.	Journal of sleep research	1999	dev	6	9	6	Genetic factors in human sleep disorders with special reference to Norrie disease, Prader-Willi syndrome and Moebius syndrome.  Sleep-wake problems are common in specific inborn errors of metabolism and structure of the central nervous system. Psychological factors, behavioural difficulties, metabolic disturbances, and widespread rather than focal damage to the nervous system are present in many of these diseases and all influence the sleep-wake cycle. However, a number of conditions cause relatively focal damage to the neuroanatomical substrate of sleeping and waking. These include fatal familial insomnia, with involvement of the prion protein gene on chromosome 20, Norrie disease, the Prader-Willi syndrome and the Moebius syndrome. The last three important conditions, although rare, are considered in detail in this review. They result in sensory deprivation, hypothalamic and mid-brain damage, and involve the X-chromosome, chromosome 15, and chromosome 13, respectively. These conditions cause a wide variety of sleep disturbance, including parasomnias, daytime sleepiness, and a condition like cataplexy. The place of the relevant gene products in normal sleep regulation needs further exploration.  
24158583	In vivo effectiveness of enamel sealants around orthodontic brackets.	Journal of orofacial orthopedics = Fortschritte der Kieferorthopadie : Organ/official journal Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Kieferorthopadie	2013	dev	2	0	0	In vivo effectiveness of enamel sealants around orthodontic brackets.  OBJECTIVE: In this randomized study, the caries-protective effect on vestibular enamel of two fluoride-containing sealants (Protecto(R) and Light Bond(R)) during multibracket treatment was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all, 40 orthodontic patients about to receive a multibracket appliance with the brackets bonded to the vestibular tooth surfaces were randomly included in this study. Each one was randomly assigned to one of four groups. A crossover design was selected in which a sealed quadrant was contralateral to an unsealed quadrant, then choosing the reverse configuration in the opposite jaw. Two sealants were, thus, tested on vestibular enamel on left and right anterior teeth and premolars in both jaws of each patient over 6 months of multibracket treatment. A DIAGNOdent(R) pen measuring laser fluorescence was used to analyze the relevant enamel surfaces both at baseline and after 6 months. RESULTS: Neither the incidence nor the characteristics of the demineralization we observed during the study differed between the 4 groups. CONCLUSION: Single application of smooth-surface sealants did not protect enamel around brackets from incipient carious lesions during the first 6 months of multibracket treatment.  
9406320	Abnormal visual P300 latency in obstructive sleep apnea does not change acutely upon treatment with CPAP.	Sleep	1997	dev	4	6	0	Abnormal visual P300 latency in obstructive sleep apnea does not change acutely upon treatment with CPAP.  This study evaluated the effects of 2-4 months of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on previously demonstrated P300 latency prolongations in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Subjects with severe OSA (respiratory disturbance index > 40/hour sleep) were administered polysomnograms, auditory and visual P300 testing using 31 scalp electrodes, and multiple sleep latency testing before and after treatment with CPAP for 2-4 months. Despite significant improvements in sleep and respiratory variables and the mean sleep latency, there were no significant P300 changes. Obstructive sleep apnea patients had prolonged visual P300 latency compared to normals, both before and after treatment. Prolongations in P300 latency that are resistant to the acute effects of CPAP may suggest that OSA causes physiological cortical changes that are unrelated to sleepiness and may be resistant to treatment.  
30067389	Low to Moderate Air Pollutant Exposure and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Severe Trauma.	American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine	2019	dev	13	12	9	Low to Moderate Air Pollutant Exposure and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Severe Trauma.  RATIONALE: Exposure to air pollution has molecular and physiologic effects on the lung that may increase the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after injury. OBJECTIVES: To determine the association of short- and long-term air pollutant exposures and ARDS risk after severe trauma. METHODS: We analyzed data from a prospective cohort of 996 critically ill patients presenting with acute trauma and an injury severity score greater than 15. Exposures to ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter less than 2.5 mum were assessed by weighted averages of daily levels from all monitors within 50 km of the geocoded location of a patient's residence. Patients were followed for 6 days for the development of ARDS according to Berlin Criteria. The association between each exposure and ARDS was determined via multivariable logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: ARDS developed in 243 (24%) patients. None of the short-term exposures averaged over the 3 days before presentation was associated with ARDS, except sulfur dioxide, which demonstrated a nonlinear association. Nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 mum in aerodynamic diameter exposure over the 6 weeks before presentation was significantly associated with ARDS (P < 0.05). All long-term exposures (3 yr) were associated with ARDS (P < 0.01) in adjusted models, despite exposure levels largely below U.S. and European Union air quality standards. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term low- to moderate-level air pollutant exposure is associated with a greater risk of developing ARDS after severe trauma and represents a novel and potentially modifiable environmental risk factor for ARDS.  
19027415	Low vitamin K intakes in community-dwelling elders at an early stage of Alzheimer's disease.	Journal of the American Dietetic Association	2008	dev	21	8	5	Low vitamin K intakes in community-dwelling elders at an early stage of Alzheimer's disease.  An increasing body of evidence points to a role for vitamin K in brain physiology through its participation in sphingolipid metabolism and biological activation of the vitamin K-dependent protein Gas6. One hypothesis is that vitamin K may also play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. A recent study found that patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease consumed less vitamin K than did cognitively intact control subjects. To learn more about the dietary intakes and food sources of vitamin K in these patients, a detailed analysis was conducted. Dietary vitamin K intakes were assessed from 5 nonconsecutive days of food records collected from 31 community-dwelling patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease and in 31 age- and sex-matched cognitively intact control subjects. Mean vitamin K intake on a person-day basis was 63+/-90 microg/day in patients and 139+/-233 microg/day in control subjects. Vitamin K intakes were significantly less in participants with Alzheimer's disease (P<0.0001), even after adjusting for energy intakes (P=0.0003). Vegetables, fats, and fruits contributed more than 70% of total vitamin K intake in both groups. The main source of vitamin K was green vegetables, which contributed 33% and 49% to total intakes in patients and control subjects, respectively. This lower consumption of green vegetables in participants with Alzheimer's disease explained their lower vitamin K intakes overall. Despite their limitations, results are in line with the most recent research in both vitamin K and Alzheimer's disease and suggest a need to consider vitamin K in future investigations on the role of diet in Alzheimer's disease.  
22581198	Segmentation in low-penetration and low-involvement categories: an application to lottery games.	Journal of gambling studies	2013	dev	0	0	0	Segmentation in low-penetration and low-involvement categories: an application to lottery games.  Market segmentation is accepted as a fundamental concept in marketing and several authors have recently proposed a segmentation model where personal and environmental variables intersect with each other to form motivating conditions that drive behavior and preferences. This model of segmentation has been applied to packaged goods. This paper extends this literature by proposing a segmentation model for low-penetration and low involvement (LP-LI) products. An application to the lottery games in Chile supports the proposed model. The results of the study show that in this type of products (LP-LI), the attitude towards the product category is the most important factor that distinguishes consumers from non consumers, and heavy users from light users, and consequently, a critical segmentation variable. In addition, a cluster analysis shows the existence of three segments: (1) the impulsive dreamers, who believe in chance, and in that lottery games can change their life, (2) the skeptical, that do not believe in chance, nor in that lottery games can change their life and (3) the willing, who value the benefits of playing.

Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking	2013	dev	7	0	0	Internet and everyday life: the perceived implications of internet use on memory and ability to concentrate.  The growing role of Internet in all aspects of everyday life has led to speculations over the impacts beyond the traditional questions of access or sociability. This in mind, the main focus in this article was to examine how Finns, for majority of whom Internet use has become commonplace activity, perceive the impacts of Internet use since first adopting the technology. In this study, we examine how Internet user history and perceived computer skills, along with different sociodemographic factors, appear to reflect on the perceived impacts of Internet adoption in terms of memory and ability to concentrate. According to the results, almost one in five of the respondents reported changes concerning their memory or ability to concentrate, with skilled computer users and nonworkers, in particular, perceiving the change. Factors such as age-related differences and exposure to potential information overload at work were identified to explain the perceived change. Our data were collected in a survey-gathering information on the everyday life and well-being of Finns. The sample consisted of 2000 Finnish speakers aged 15 to 64 years. The response rate was 46 percent (N=908).

International journal of food sciences and nutrition	2013	dev	26	0	0	Optimization of a fermented soy product formulation with a kefir culture and fiber using a simplex-centroid mixture design.  The objective of this work was to optimize a fermented soy product formulation with kefir and soy, oat and wheat fibers and to evaluate the fiber and product characteristics. A simplex-centroid mixture design was used for the optimization. Soymilk, soy, oat and wheat fiber mixtures, sucrose and anti-foaming agent were used for the formulation, followed by thermal treatment, cooling and the addition of flavoring. Fermentation was performed at 25 degreesC with a kefir culture until a pH of 4.5 was obtained. The products were cooled, homogenized and stored for analysis. From the mathematical models and variables response surface and desirability an optimal fermented product was formulated containing 3% (w/w) soy fiber. Compared with the other formulations, soy fermented product with 3% soy fiber had the best acidity, viscosity, syneresis, firmness and Lactococcus lactis count.  
31843807	Nightly sleep duration, fragmentation, and quality and daily risk of migraine.	Neurology	2020	dev	18	9	6	Nightly sleep duration, fragmentation, and quality and daily risk of migraine.  OBJECTIVE: To test the hypotheses that insufficient duration, high fragmentation, and poor sleep quality are temporally associated with migraine onset on the day immediately following the sleep period (day 0) and the following day (day 1). METHODS: In this prospective cohort study of 98 adults with episodic migraine, participants completed twice-daily electronic diaries on sleep, headaches, and other health habits, and wore wrist actigraphs for 6 weeks. We estimated the incidence of migraine following nights with short sleep duration, high fragmentation, or low quality compared to nights with adequate sleep with conditional logistic regression models stratified by participant and adjusted for caffeine intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, stress, and day of week. RESULTS: Participants were a mean age of 35.1 +/- 12.1 years. We collected 4,406 days of data, with 870 headaches reported. Sleep duration <=6.5 hours and poor sleep quality were not associated with migraine on day 0 or day 1. Diary-reported low efficiency was associated with 39% higher odds of headache on day 1 (odds ratio [OR] 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.81). Actigraphic-assessed high fragmentation was associated with lower odds of migraine on day 0 (wake after sleep onset >53 minutes, OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48-0.86; efficiency <=88%, OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.99). CONCLUSION: Short sleep duration and low sleep quality were not temporally associated with migraine. Sleep fragmentation, defined by low sleep efficiency, was associated with higher odds of migraine on day 1. Further research is needed to understand the clinical and neurobiologic implications of sleep fragmentation and risk of migraine.  
17635889	Influence of a diet very high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber and low in fat on prognosis following treatment for breast cancer: the Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) randomized trial.	JAMA	2007	dev	37	10	2	"Influence of a diet very high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber and low in fat on prognosis following treatment for breast cancer: the Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) randomized trial.  CONTEXT: Evidence is lacking that a dietary pattern high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber and low in total fat can influence breast cancer recurrence or survival. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a major increase in vegetable, fruit, and fiber intake and a decrease in dietary fat intake reduces the risk of recurrent and new primary breast cancer and all-cause mortality among women with previously treated early stage breast cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multi-institutional randomized controlled trial of dietary change in 3088 women previously treated for early stage breast cancer who were 18 to 70 years old at diagnosis. Women were enrolled between 1995 and 2000 and followed up through June 1, 2006. INTERVENTION: The intervention group (n = 1537) was randomly assigned to receive a telephone counseling program supplemented with cooking classes and newsletters that promoted daily targets of 5 vegetable servings plus 16 oz of vegetable juice; 3 fruit servings; 30 g of fiber; and 15% to 20% of energy intake from fat. The comparison group (n = 1551) was provided with print materials describing the ""5-A-Day"" dietary guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Invasive breast cancer event (recurrence or new primary) or death from any cause. RESULTS: From comparable dietary patterns at baseline, a conservative imputation analysis showed that the intervention group achieved and maintained the following statistically significant differences vs the comparison group through 4 years: servings of vegetables, +65%; fruit, +25%; fiber, +30%, and energy intake from fat, -13%. Plasma carotenoid concentrations validated changes in fruit and vegetable intake. Throughout the study, women in both groups received similar clinical care. Over the mean 7.3-year follow-up, 256 women in the intervention group (16.7%) vs 262 in the comparison group (16.9%) experienced an invasive breast cancer event (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-1.14; P = .63), and 155 intervention group women (10.1%) vs 160 comparison group women (10.3%) died (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-1.15; P = .43). No significant interactions were observed between diet group and baseline demographics, characteristics of the original tumor, baseline dietary pattern, or breast cancer treatment. CONCLUSION: Among survivors of early stage breast cancer, adoption of a diet that was very high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber and low in fat did not reduce additional breast cancer events or mortality during a 7.3-year follow-up period.

32453288	A Randomized Internet-Based Pilot Feasibility and Planning Study of Cherry Extract and Diet Modification in Gout.	Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases	2020	dev	11	10	5	A Randomized Internet-Based Pilot Feasibility and Planning Study of Cherry Extract and Diet Modification in Gout.  OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a 9-month pilot Internet randomized controlled trial (RCT) of cherry extract and diet modification in gout to assess the feasibility of an Internet study and obtain effect estimates. METHODS: After providing online informed consent in response to Internet advertisements and social media or clinic flyers, 84 people with physician-confirmed gout were randomized to either cherry extract 3,600 mg/d (n = 41) or dietitian-assisted diet modification for gout (n = 43). All study outcomes were collected via Internet and phone calls. The primary objective was the feasibility of an Internet study, and secondary objectives were to obtain effect estimates for gout flares, functional ability assessed with the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and adverse events (AEs) for future trials. RESULTS: Of the 84 people randomized, overall completion rates were more than 80% for most study procedures up to 6 months and similar for the 2 active comparators. Improvements were seen in gout flares and HAQ scores in cherry extract and diet modification groups at 9 months compared with baseline: gout flares per month, 0.22 versus 0.36 (p = 0.049) and 0.28 versus 0.31 (p = 0.76); proportion with any gout flare, 56% versus 98% (p < 0.0001) and 65% versus 98% (p = 0.0002); and mean +/- standard deviation HAQ score, 0.28 +/- 0.54 versus 0.55 +/- 0.68 (p = 0.001) and 0.23 +/- 0.40 versus 0.48 +/- 0.61 (p = 0.06), respectively. Any AEs and gastrointestinal symptoms/AEs at 9 months in cherry extract and diet modification groups were 3% versus 0% and 28% versus 27%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: An Internet gout RCT is feasible for nonpharmacological gout treatments. A hypothesis-testing, large Internet RCT of cherry extract versus placebo is needed.  
31339996	Infertility-related stress and the risk of antidepressants prescription in women: a 10-year register study.	Human reproduction (Oxford, England)	2019	dev	7	14	0	Infertility-related stress and the risk of antidepressants prescription in women: a 10-year register study.  STUDY QUESTION: Is the first-time redeemed prescription of antidepressants predicted by the level of infertility-related stress in women seeking ART treatment? SUMMARY ANSWER: Infertility-related stress in the personal and marital domains and general physical stress reactions were significant predictors of a first redeemed prescription of antidepressants after ART treatment in this 10-year follow-up cohort study. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The literature has found inconsistent findings regarding the association between infertility-related stress and later psychological adjustment in fertility patients. The association between infertility-related stress and later prescription of antidepressants had never been explored in long-term cohort studies. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: All women (n = 1169) who participated in the Copenhagen Cohort Multi-centre Psychosocial Infertility (COMPI) cohort study in the year 2000 (questionnaire data) were linked with the register-based Danish National ART-Couple (DANAC) I cohort, which includes women and their partners having received ART treatment from 1 January 1994 to 30 September 2009. The study population were among other national health and sociodemographic registers further linked with the Danish National Prescription Registry. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women initiating ART treatment were followed until they had redeemed the first prescription of antidepressants or until 31 December 2009. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to test the association between general physical stress reactions and infertility-related stress in the personal, marital and social domains, respectively, and a future redeemed prescription of antidepressants. Age, education level, marital status, number of fertility treatments prior to study inclusion and female infertility diagnosis were included as covariates in the adjusted analyses. Further, the analysis was stratified according to childbirth or no childbirth during follow-up. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The final sample consisted of 1009 women with a mean age of 31.8 years. At study inclusion, women had tried to conceive for an average of 3.45 years. At 10-year follow-up, a total of 13.7% of women had a first redeemed prescription of antidepressant medication. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) showed that high general physical stress predicted the later prescription of antidepressants (adjusted (adj) OR = 2.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.96-4.16). Regarding infertility-related stress domains, high personal stress (adj OR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.46-3.13) and high marital stress (adj OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.23-2.64) were significantly associated with the later prescription of antidepressants. Social stress was not significantly associated with the future redeemed prescription of antidepressants (adj OR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.76-1.61). Among women not having achieved childbirth during follow-up, the risk of a first-time prescription of antidepressants associated with infertility-specific stress was higher compared to the risk among women having childbirth during follow-up. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study did not account for potential mediating factors, such as negative life events, which could be associated with the prescription of antidepressants. Second, we are not able to know if these women had sought psychological support during follow-up. Additionally, antidepressants might be prescribed for other health conditions than depressive disorders. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results suggest that women presenting high infertility-related stress in the personal and marital domains were at higher risk of redeemed first-time prescription of antidepressants after ART, independently of having delivered a child or not after initiation of ART treatment. Women would benefit from an initial screening specifically for high infertility-related stress. The COMPI Fertility Problem Stress Scales can be used by clinical staff in order to identify women in need of psychological support before starting ART treatments.

3780410	Religion and attitudes towards alcohol use in the Western Isles.	Drug and alcohol dependence	1986	dev	10	0	0	Religion and attitudes towards alcohol use in the Western Isles.  Research on religion and alcohol has produced conclusive results with regard to the relationship between religion and alcohol consumption but ambiguous findings with regard to more general attitudes towards alcohol use. This paper considers these issues in depth by a secondary analysis of data collected in the Western Isles of Scotland. It finds that differences between Protestants and Catholics do exist: Protestants are more likely to endorse an abstinent position, while Catholics are more permissive in their attitudes towards drinking. In terms of attitudes towards drunkenness, however, differences between the two groups are slight. The paper concludes by giving data on differences in attitudes towards alcoholism and service use and calls for future studies in the area to take the cultural context of these issues into account.  
26620745	Relation of Sociodemographics and Personal Hygiene on Different Childhood Dermatoses.	Kathmandu University medical journal (KUMJ)	2015	dev	11	14	5	Relation of Sociodemographics and Personal Hygiene on Different Childhood Dermatoses.  BACKGROUND: Skin diseases in children contribute to significant morbidity and psychological distress. Infective dermatoses are one of the major dermatoses in children. Low socioeconomic status, overcrowding and poor personal hygiene has been linked to skin diseases. OBJECTIVE: To find out the prevalence of infectious skin disease in children, rate of transmissible skin disease and association of sociodemographic factors and personal hygiene on infective childhood dermatoses. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the Pediatric and Dermatology Department, Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal. A total of 226 patients were examined over a period of one year. Relation of sociodemographics, crowding and personal hygiene on skin disease were assessed. RESULT: The most common category was Infections and Infestations (51.3%) followed by Dermatitis (27.9%). Transmissible skin disease was seen in 49.6%. Low socioeconomic status and overcrowding were associated with increased risk for infective dermatoses. CONCLUSION: Skin disease in children constitutes a public health problem. Improving the socioeconomic status and personal hygiene can help to reduce the incidence of skin disease in children.

Minimally processed ready-to-eat baby-leaf vegetables (BLVs) are the most convenient source to include the health beneficial bioactive in the daily diet. In the present study, the visual quality and storage stability of carotenoids, tocopherols were investigated in lettuce (green and red romaine) and salad rocket BLVs. The commercially packed samples of BLVs were stored at 0 degreesC and 4 degreesC in dark conditions and analyzed after 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 days of storage. All the studied samples were found in better visual quality up to eight days of storage at both the temperatures. In most cases, the quality was correlated with the chlorophyll contents. The highest significant (p < 0.05) positive changes in total carotenoids and tocopherols were observed in samples stored at 4 degreesC. Also, carotenoids and tocopherols are maximum stable in green and red romaine lettuce, respectively.

Drug and alcohol dependence	1980	dev	18	0	0	"Drug attitudes and discrimination between drugs among a group of English schoolchildren.  This study investigates the attitudes of a group of 185 London schoolchildren towards a number of legal and illegal drugs, and examines the ways in which they discriminate between these drugs. Heroin and LSD were seen as the most dangerous drugs, and alcohol and cigarettes as the safest. Subjects who had a negative attitude towards drugs in general regarded cannabis, amphetamines, alcohol and tobacco as more dangerous than subjects with a neutral or pro-drug attitude. There was also a sex difference: boys claimed to know more about drugs, were more likely to know a cannabis user and to have been ""really drunk"" than the girls. The implications of these results for drug and alcohol education programmes are discussed.  "
16443282	Pathological gambling and mood disorders: clinical associations and treatment implications.	Journal of affective disorders	2006	dev	4	16	1	Pathological gambling and mood disorders: clinical associations and treatment implications.  BACKGROUND: The rapidly expanding gambling business has resulted in an increasing number of gamblers, and the problem is likely to get worse in the future. Traditionally, mood and gambling symptoms have been known to overlap. In the present review we attempt to examine the diagnostic associations and implications for treatment. METHOD: Selected published papers on the frequencies of mood disorders among patients who have gambling disorder or gambling disorder among patients who have mood disorder have been reviewed. Recently emerging new treatment methods for gambling disorder have been reviewed and a brief summary has been added. RESULTS: SCID based study results show a close link between gambling and mood disorders. The prevalence of manic disorder reaches to approximately one fourth of the pathological gambling disorder population. The prevalence of depression is much higher, reaching to over half of the population in some studies. LIMITATIONS: The studies included in the present paper involve inpatients, outpatients, subjects recruited through advertisements and prison populations. Thus the data need to be interpreted as such. Standardized assessment instruments are not used in all studies. Methodological issues such as primary or secondary nature of depression have not been addressed adequately in these studies. The findings, however, offer new insights for the assessment and treatment of complicated gambling disorder cases. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence rate of manic and depressive disorders has been recorded among pathological gambling disorder patients. A rational treatment approach to each defined subset of complicated gambling disorder is discussed.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the association of dental caries with behavioural, socioeconomic and cultural factors; and Streptococcus mutans (SM) levels in the saliva and oral hygiene index of children aged 4 and 6 years old placed in an oral health programme. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was an analytic cross-sectional oral health survey conducted over a 9-month period. A total of 466 children aged 4 and 6 years old were included for evaluation of SM levels in saliva, simplified oral hygiene index and dental caries activity. RESULTS: High SM levels were associated with dmft index, toothbrushing without parental assistance, deficient oral hygiene and ingestion of sweet foods. Deficient oral hygiene was found in children aged 4 years old and with three or more siblings. Dental caries was associated with low family income, deficient oral hygiene, sucrose ingestion by children younger than three years old, bottle-feeding habit and low parental compliance. CONCLUSIONS: High SM levels in saliva, deficient oral hygiene and high frequency of sucrose ingestion had association with dental caries in children. Cultural, socioeconomic and behaviour factors indirectly influenced the onset of dental caries.  
29149528	Improving oral health in the Middle East - recommendations from the first Middle East Oral Hygiene Advisory Board meeting.	International dental journal	2010	dev	21	10	17	Improving oral health in the Middle East - recommendations from the first Middle East Oral Hygiene Advisory Board meeting.  Chronic periodontitis may be a sequela of chronic gingivitis, usually because of accumulation of plaque and calculus. Consistent good dental hygiene can help prevent gingivitis and periodontitis. Mechanical removal of plaque through frequent and efficacious brushing and flossing is the principal means of preventing periodontal diseases and diminishing the risk of caries. According to the American Dental Association (ADA), antimicrobial mouth-washes may provide additional oral health benefits, in addition to brushing and flossing, for preventing and reducing gingivitis and plaque. There is a multitude of mouthwashes available for these purposes. The consensus panel of the Middle East Oral Hygiene Advisory Board has recommended that an antiseptic mouthwash should be used as a daily adjunct to mechanical cleaning for prevention of oral disease. Recommending particular mouthwashes should take into consideration the patient's ability to perform good oral hygiene practices (tooth brushing and dental flossing), the condition of the patient's teeth, gingivae and oral mucosa, and the proven efficacy of the mouthwash along with its potential adverse effects. Of the many mouth rinses available, only a few contain chemical agents that have some ability to penetrate biofilm and to kill plaque biofilm bacteria. Currently, only chlorhexidine mouthrinse and Listerine (an essential oil-containing mouth rinse) products, with the claim of plaque and gingivitis reduction, have been accepted for that purpose by the ADA and have a proven record of safety and efficacy. Essential oil-containing mouthrinses have been clinically proven as effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis. Dental care professionals should spend time discussing biofilm control with their patients, and be an information source for the best oral care products. Therefore, it is essential that dental care professionals should continue to monitor published research and work with their colleagues to make evidence-based decisions. In this way, patients will be directed to dental hygiene aids, including antiseptic mouthwashes that can be most effective for improving their oral health.  
25329006	Postprandial Metabolic Effects of Accelerometer Measured Spontaneous Low-Level Activity.	Journal of physical activity & health	2015	dev	7	0	0	Postprandial Metabolic Effects of Accelerometer Measured Spontaneous Low-Level Activity.  BACKGROUND: Interrupting sedentary time induces improvements in glucose metabolism; however, it is unclear how much activity is required to reduce the negative effects of prolonged sitting. METHODS: Sixty-six participants sat continuously for 9 hours except for required bathroom breaks. Participants were fed meal replacement beverages at 60, 240 and 420 min. Blood samples were obtained hourly for 9 hours, with additional samples collected 30 and 45 min after each feeding. Responses were calculated as incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for plasma glucose, insulin and triglyceride. Participants wore a triaxial accelerometer and a heart rate monitor. Energy expenditure was estimated using indirect calorimetry. RESULTS: After controlling for age, sex and BMI, every 100 count increase in accelerometer derived total movement was associated with a 0.06 mmol.L-1.9 hours decrease in glucose iAUC (95% CI 0.004-0.1; P = .035), but not associated with changes in insulin or triglyceride iAUC. Every 1 bpm increase in mean heart rate was associated with a 0.76 mmol.L-1.9 hours increase in triglyceride iAUC (95% CI 0.13-1.38). CONCLUSION: Accelerometer measured movement during periods of prolonged sitting can result in minor improvements in postprandial glucose metabolism, but not lipid metabolism.  
28470840	Vitamin D deficiency causes rickets in an urban informal settlement in Kenya and is associated with malnutrition.	Maternal & child nutrition	2018	dev	12	11	3	Vitamin D deficiency causes rickets in an urban informal settlement in Kenya and is associated with malnutrition.  The commonest cause of rickets worldwide is vitamin D deficiency, but studies from sub-Saharan Africa describe an endemic vitamin D-independent form that responds to dietary calcium enrichment. The extent to which calcium-deficiency rickets is the dominant form across sub-Saharan Africa and in other low-latitude areas is unknown. We aimed to characterise the clinical and biochemical features of young children with rickets in a densely populated urban informal settlement in Kenya. Because malnutrition may mask the clinical features of rickets, we also looked for biochemical indices of risk in children with varying degrees of acute malnutrition. Twenty one children with rickets, aged 3 to 24 months, were identified on the basis of clinical and radiologic features, along with 22 community controls, and 41 children with either severe or moderate acute malnutrition. Most children with rickets had wrist widening (100%) and rachitic rosary (90%), as opposed to lower limb features (19%). Developmental delay (52%), acute malnutrition (71%), and stunting (62%) were common. Compared to controls, there were no differences in calcium intake, but most (71%) had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 30 nmol/L. These results suggest that rickets in young children in urban Kenya is usually driven by vitamin D deficiency, and vitamin D supplementation is likely to be required for full recovery. Wasting was associated with lower calcium (p = .001), phosphate (p < .001), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (p = .049), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (p = 0.022) levels, the clinical significance of which remain unclear.  
15309455	Beyond deficiency: potential benefits of increased intakes of vitamin K for bone and vascular health.	European journal of nutrition	2004	dev	7	0	0	Beyond deficiency: potential benefits of increased intakes of vitamin K for bone and vascular health.  Vitamin K is well known for its role in the synthesis of a number of blood coagulation factors. During recent years vitamin K-dependent proteins were discovered to be of vital importance for bone and vascular health. Recommendations for dietary vitamin K intake have been made on the basis of the hepatic requirements for the synthesis of blood coagulation factors. Accumulating evidence suggests that the requirements for other functions than blood coagulation may be higher. This paper is the result of a closed workshop (Paris, November 2002) in which a number of European vitamin K experts reviewed the available data and formulated their standpoint with respect to recommended dietary vitamin K intake and the use of vitamin K-containing supplements.  
9678133	Oral contraceptives and venous thromboembolism: an epidemiological review.	The European journal of contraception & reproductive health care : the official journal of the European Society of Contraception	1996	dev	12	5	2	Oral contraceptives and venous thromboembolism: an epidemiological review.  New epidemiological studies have demonstrated a higher risk of venous thromboembolism among users of oral contraceptives (OCs) with third-generation progestogens desogestrel or gestodene compared with users of OCs with second-generation progestogens levonorgestrel or norgestrel. As the absolute risk of venous thromboembolism among users of OCs in general is lower in the new studies than in previously published studies, and as several important potential confounders are not controlled for in the new studies, the real difference in risk of venous thromboembolism between users of third- compared with second-generation products may be smaller than indicated in these new studies. At the same time, the risk of myocardial infarction may be smaller among users of third- compared with users of second-generation products. Until further epidemiological data emerge, it is therefore difficult to make general recommendations other than to use OCs with a low estrogen dose, and to make individual recommendations based on age, individual wish, and individual risk factors.  
14991269	The DONALD Study. History, current status and future perspectives.	European journal of nutrition	2004	dev	7	3	0	The DONALD Study. History, current status and future perspectives.  Nutrition during childhood and adolescence is an important determinant of development and health, both for the child and the later adult. In industrialised countries as well as in many countries of economic transition, emphasis has moved from combating nutrient deficiencies to research on the effects of overnutrition and food selection. Prevention of chronic diseases including obesity have become a major focus in research. However, the complex relation between infant growth and its related endocrine and metabolic changes on the one hand and the influence of nutrition and nutritional status on the other hand still need to be understood in detail. Studies aiming to elucidate this have to follow children and adolescents during their growth period. The following pages display the features of the German DONALD Study ( DOrtmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed Study) which was specifically designed to address these complex research questions. Finally, comparisons to other studies are made and the specific strength and weaknesses of this study are discussed. As the DONALD study offers unique research opportunities and due to its long follow-up an abundance of data, collaborative research is encouraged.  
15071147	Smile aesthetics and malocclusion in UK teenage magazines assessed using the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN).	Journal of orthodontics	2004	dev	3	0	0	Smile aesthetics and malocclusion in UK teenage magazines assessed using the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN).  OBJECTIVE: There is a significant demand for orthodontic treatment within the UK from adolescent girls, a group known to be influenced by the media portrayal of body form and body image, which may extend to the presentation of malocclusions. This study examined the portrayal of malocclusion in a media type that targets teenage girls under 16 years of age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A representative selection of 1 month's magazines targeting this group were investigated, and the frequency and severity of malocclusions displayed were assessed. Two calibrated examiners viewed all the smiles (on two occasions) using a modification of Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) and assigned an Aesthetic Component Score to each smile. RESULTS: It was found that the aesthetic score is low (less than 7) for the majority of models (92.8%) indicating no need or a borderline need for treatment. Only 7.2% of models exhibited a definite need for treatment. CONCLUSION: It appears that the portrayal of malocclusion in teenage magazines does not reflect the general treatment need of the adolescent population.  
9156693	Lung cancer risk in relation to the CYP2E1 Rsa I genetic polymorphism among African-Americans and Caucasians in Los Angeles County.	Pharmacogenetics	1996	dev	10	9	0	Lung cancer risk in relation to the CYP2E1 Rsa I genetic polymorphism among African-Americans and Caucasians in Los Angeles County.  Genetic polymorphisms in the activation or detoxication of carcinogens, such as those in tobacco smoke, may produce differences in individual susceptibility to lung cancer. The cytochrome P450 CYP2E1 is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of nitrosamines in tobacco smoke. A polymorphism of CYP2E1 detectable by the restriction enzyme Rsa I may be functionally important because it is located in a putative binding site for the transcription factor HNF-1 and has been associated with higher levels of CYP2E1 transcription. It is conceivable that this CYP2E1 Rsa I polymorphism might contribute to differences in susceptibility to lung cancer. We conducted a case-control study of patients with incident lung cancer and population controls in Los Angeles County to examine the association between the CYP2E1 Rsa I polymorphism and lung cancer risk among African-Americans and Caucasians. Samples of white blood cell DNA sufficient for determination of the CYP2E1 Rsa I genotype by a polymerase chain reaction-based assay were obtained from 341 cases and 706 controls with data on lifetime smoking history. No subjects were homozygous for the CYP2E1 Rsa I rare c2 allele. The rare c2 allele was not associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (adjusted odds ratio, OR 0.72; 95% confidence interval, CI = 0.35-1.46). Among the population controls the percentage of subjects carrying the rare c2 allele was lower (p = 0.002) among African-Americans (2%) compared with Caucasians (8%). However, the association between the CYP2E1 Rsa I genotype and lung cancer risk did not differ between ethnic groups. There was no important association between the CYP2E1 Rsa I genotype and lung cancer risk in analyses stratified by cell-type, smoking history, gender, occupational asbestos exposure, and dietary intake of antioxidants vitamin C, vitamin E or beta carotene. Due to the low frequency of the c2 allele in these populations, larger studies would be necessary to rule out a modest association between the CYP2E1 Rsa I polymorphism and lung cancer risk.  
33291720	The Benefits of Vitamin D Supplementation for Athletes: Better Performance and Reduced Risk of COVID-19.	Nutrients	2020	dev	11	8	3	"The Benefits of Vitamin D Supplementation for Athletes: Better Performance and Reduced Risk of COVID-19.  The COVID-19 pandemic is having major economic and personal consequences for collegiate and professional sports. Sporting events have been canceled or postponed, and even when baseball and basketball seasons resumed in the United States recently, no fans were in attendance. As play resumed, several players developed COVID-19, disrupting some of the schedules. A hypothesis now under scientific consideration is that taking vitamin supplements to raise serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations could quickly reduce the risk and/or severity of COVID-19. Several mechanisms have been identified through which vitamin D could reduce the risks of infection and severity, death, and long-haul effects of COVID-19: (1) inducing production of cathelicidin and defensins to reduce the survival and replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus; (2) reducing inflammation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines and risk of the ""cytokine storm"" that damages the epithelial layer of the lungs, heart, vascular system, and other organs; and (3) increasing production of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, thus limiting the amount of angiotensin II available to the virus to cause damage. Clinical trials have confirmed that vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of acute respiratory tract infections, and approximately 30 observational studies have shown that incidence, severity, and death from COVID-19 are inversely correlated with serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Vitamin D supplementation is already familiar to many athletes and sports teams because it improves athletic performance and increases playing longevity. Thus, athletes should consider vitamin D supplementation to serve as an additional means by which to reduce risk of COVID-19 and its consequences.  "
11813678	Establishing community partnerships: providing better oral health care to underserved children.	Journal of dental hygiene : JDH	2001	test	5	1	0	Establishing community partnerships: providing better oral health care to underserved children.  A community partnership between a dental hygiene school and a social service program was designed to improve oral health outcomes and reduce disparities among children. This resulted in a preventive oral hygiene care project that complimented the dental hygiene program's didactic curriculum. The children received much needed oral health care and education, while the experiences enhanced dental hygiene student learning by applying the principles for planning, implementing, and evaluating dental health programs; establishing a context for understanding the prevalence of oral disease as well the disparity among population subsets; and developing a variety of clinical skills. Oral health professionals and dental hygiene programs may find this partnership a prototype of a highly productive and beneficial community health experience that could be incorporated, in part or in it's entirety, into their own community health projects.  
21372857	Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of isoeugenol (CAS No. 97-54-1) in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice (gavage studies).	National Toxicology Program technical report series	2010	test	51	18	11	Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of isoeugenol (CAS No. 97-54-1) in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice (gavage studies).  Isoeugenol is one of several structurally similar phenylpropenoid compounds produced by plants. It has been extracted from calamus, savory, basil, ylang-ylang, clove, tuberose, jonquil, nutmeg, tobacco, sandalwood, dill seed, mace, gardenia, petunia, and other flowers. Isoeugenol can also be produced by isomerization of eugenol, which occurs naturally in clove, pimento, bay leaf, and cinnamon. As a fragrance with a spicy, carnation-like odor, isoeugenol is incorporated into numerous household and personal hygiene products, including perfumes, cream lotions, soaps, and detergents. As a flavoring agent, isoeugenol is added to nonalcoholic drinks, baked foods, and chewing gums. Isoeugenol was nominated by the National Cancer Institute and was selected for carcinogenicity testing because of widespread human exposure through its use as a flavoring and fragrance agent and because of its structural similarity to phenylpropenoids such as safrole, isosafrole, eugenol, methyleugenol, estragole, and anethole, most of which are known rodent carcinogens. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were administered isoeugenol (99% or greater pure) in corn oil by gavage for 3 months or 2 years. Genetic toxicity tests were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 3-MONTH STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 37.5, 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. All rats survived to the end of the study except one 600 mg/kg male and one 37.5 mg/kg female that were killed in dosing accidents. Mean body weights of all exposed groups of males were significantly less than that of the vehicle control group; however, only the decrease for the 600 mg/kg group exceeded 10% and was considered related to isoeugenol exposure. Liver weights were significantly increased in 300 and 600 mg/kg females. The incidences of minimal atrophy of the olfactory epithelium of the nose were significantly increased in 150 mg/kg or greater males and in 300 or 600 mg/kg females. The incidence of atrophy of olfactory nerve bundles was significantly increased in 600 mg/kg females. Minimal to mild periportal hepatocellular cytoplasmic alteration occurred in all 300 or 600 mg/kg females. 3-MONTH STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 37.5, 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. All mice survived to the end of the study. The mean body weight of 600 mg/kg males was significantly less (12%) than that of the vehicle controls. Liver weights of 300 and 600 mg/kg males were significantly greater than those of the vehicle controls. Minimal to moderate atrophy of olfactory epithelial tissue and nerve bundles was observed in 600 mg/kg males and females. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 105 weeks. Survival rates of exposed male and female rats were similar to those of vehicle controls. Mean body weights of 300 mg/kg male rats were 9% greater than the vehicle controls at the end of the study. The general lack of toxicity and nonneoplastic lesions indicates that rats might have been able to tolerate higher doses. Two male rats in the 300 mg/kg group had rare benign or malignant thymomas, while two other males in this group had rare mammary gland carcinomas. Low incidences of minimal atrophy and minimal to mild respiratory metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium were increased in 150 mg/kg males and 300 mg/kg males and females. Similar incidences of minimal to mild olfactory epithelial degeneration in 300 mg/kg males were also increased. Incidences of keratoacanthoma of the skin were decreased in 150 and 300 mg/kg males. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 104 (females) or 105 (males) weeks. Survival of 300 mg/kg males was significantly decreased compared to the vehicle controls. Mean body weights of 300 mg/kg male and female groups were less than those of vehicle controls at the end of the study, 10% and 15% less, respectively. In all groups of exposed males, the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly greater than those in the vehicle control group; incidences of multiple hepatocellular adenoma were also significantly increased. Incidences of clear cell focus were significantly increased in 75 and 150 mg/kg male mice. There was a significant positive trend in the incidences of histiocytic sarcoma in females, and this neoplasm occurred in multiple tissues. Incidences of respiratory metaplasia in olfactory epithelium in all exposed groups and of atrophy and hyaline droplet accumulation in all exposed groups except 75 mg/kg females were significantly greater than those in corresponding vehicle control groups. Incidences of minimal to marked hyperplasia of Bowman's gland were increased significantly in all exposed groups. Incidences of minimal to mild necrosis of renal papilla and mild to moderate necrosis of renal tubules were increased significantly in 300 mg/kg females. Incidences of forestomach squamous hyperplasia, inflammation, and ulceration (males only) increased with exposure and were significant in the 300 mg/kg groups. The incidence of glandular stomach ulcers was low but significantly increased in the 300 mg/kg groups. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Isoeugenol was not mutagenic in two independent assays in bacteria (S. typhimurium and E. coli) conducted with and without exogenous metabolic activation (S9 liver enzymes). Neither did it induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with or without S9 activation. Frequencies of micronucleated erythrocytes were not increased in peripheral blood of male mice exposed to isoeugenol by gavage for 3 months; however, an increasing trend and a threefold increase in the 600 mg/kg group indicate a positive result for this test in female mice. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of rarely occurring thymoma and mammary gland carcinoma. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in female F344/N rats administered 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined). There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of histiocytic sarcoma. Exposure to isoeugenol resulted in nonneoplastic lesions of the nose in male and female rats; of the nose, forestomach, and glandular stomach in male and female mice; and of the kidney in female mice.  
29913726	Intrathecal administration of antioxidants attenuates mechanical pain hypersensitivity induced by REM sleep deprivation in the rat.	Scandinavian journal of pain	2011	test	22	5	0	Intrathecal administration of antioxidants attenuates mechanical pain hypersensitivity induced by REM sleep deprivation in the rat.  Background Sleep deprivation as well as peripheral neuropathy and cutaneous neurogenic inflammation has a facilitatory effect on pain perception. Here we studied whether oxidative stress-related mechanisms in the spinal cord that have been shown to contribute to pain facilitation in peripheral neuropathy and cutaneous neurogenic inflammation play a role in sleep deprivation-induced pain hypersensitivity Methods Flower pot method was used to induce rapid eye movement sleep deprivation (REMSD) of 48 h duration in the rat that had a chronic intrathecal (i.t.) catheter for spinal administration of drugs. Pain behavior was assessed by determining the monofilament-induced limb withdrawal response. Results REMSD of 48 h produced mechanical hypersensitivity that was attenuated in a dose-related fashion by i.t. administration of two different antioxidants, phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) or 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1 oxyl (TEMPOL). While both antioxidants attenuated mechanical pain behavior also in control animals, their effects were significantly stronger after REMSD than in control conditions. Conversely, i.t. administration of a reactive oxygen species (ROS) donor, tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BOOH), in control animals produced pain hypersensitivity that was prevented by i.t. pretreatment with an antioxidant, TEMPOL. I.t. treatment with PBN or TEMPOL at the currently used doses failed to influence motor behavior in the Rotarod test. Conclusions The results indicate that among common mechanisms contributing to mechanical pain hypersensitivity following sleep deprivation as well as nerve injury or neurogenic inflammation is oxidative stress in the spinal cord. Implications Compounds with antioxidant properties might prove useful in suppressing the vicious pronociceptive interaction between chronic pain and sleep-deprivation.  
19817639	Effects of Manisa propolis on telomerase activity in leukemia cells obtained from the bone marrow of leukemia patients.	International journal of food sciences and nutrition	2009	test	7	6	0	Effects of Manisa propolis on telomerase activity in leukemia cells obtained from the bone marrow of leukemia patients.  Propolis is a resinous material collected by honeybees and obtained from beehives that has anticancer effects by inducing apoptosis. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of propolis on human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) in the leukemia cells obtained from leukemia patients. Four different bone marrow cell cultures from each of four leukemia cases were prepared. The 60 ng/ml, 30 ng/ml and 15 ng/ml working concentrations of propolis were administered to three cultures of each patient, while one culture contained only culture medium. hTERT mRNA expression levels of cells were detected at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h using the LightCycler 2.0 instrument. A significant decrease in hTERT expression levels was observed in the 60 ng/ml concentration of propolis. In conclusion, Manisa propolis may also have a potential effect on the expression of hTERT in leukemia-particularly owing to its constituent chrysin.  
20074393	Risk factors for childhood obesity in a Greek paediatric population.	Public health nutrition	2010	test	13	12	8	Risk factors for childhood obesity in a Greek paediatric population.  OBJECTIVE: Obesity in children is a serious public health issue in Greece. The purpose of the current study was to identify risk factors such as birth weight, breast-feeding, dietary patterns, family history of obesity and sedentary behaviours that are possibly associated with paediatric obesity. DESIGN: Two hundred and five overweight and obese children (OW/OB; group 1) aged 7-15 years from eight primary and secondary schools and a control group (group 2) of normal-weight children were matched for age and sex. Overweight and obesity were calculated based on the International Obesity Taskforce criteria. Lifestyle parameters as well as anthropometric data were collected in all children. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for obesity. RESULTS: Breast-feeding (> or =3 months) and leisure-time physical activity proved to be protector factors against obesity (OR = 0.21, 95 % CI 0.11, 0.79, P < 0.001 and OR = 0.87, 95 % CI 0.85, 0.89, P < 0.001 respectively). On the other hand, family history of obesity (OR = 3.79, 95 % CI 2.61, 4.18, P < 0.001), sugar-sweetened beverage consumption (OR = 1.77, 95 % CI 1.03, 2.76, P < 0.001) and watching television (OR = 1.99, 95 % CI 1.54, 2.76, P = 0.04) were found to be positively associated with a higher obesity risk. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings support the literature according to which duration of breast-feeding (<3 months), a family history of obesity, watching television, sedentary lifestyle and consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages are important risk factors for childhood obesity. More studies are needed to elucidate the relationship of paediatric obesity and possible predictor factors in order to avoid health consequences in these children later on in life.  
21726980	The sleep-deprived brain in normals and patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy: a perturbational approach to measuring cortical reactivity.	Epilepsy research	2011	test	11	9	0	The sleep-deprived brain in normals and patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy: a perturbational approach to measuring cortical reactivity.  Simultaneous electroencephalography-transcranial magnetic stimulation (EEG-TMS) investigates cortical reactivity to external perturbations. TMS evoked potentials (TEPs) have been described in normals during sleep and wake but not after sleep deprivation or in pathologically enhanced excitability, i.e., epilepsy. The aim of our study was to identify TEPs and their modifications via EEG-TMS co-registration in healthy controls and patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) during wake, sleep deprivation and sleep conditions. Focal TMS was administered to the primary motor cortex in 12 healthy controls and 10 patients with JME. At least 150 TMS were delivered randomly every 8-15s during wake, sleep deprivation and sleep conditions. EEG was simultaneously acquired from 32 scalp electrodes. A significant increase in late peak amplitudes (P100 and N190) was observed in all subjects during the sleep-deprived condition, with a marked anterior increase and overall higher amplitude potentials in the JME patients. We demonstrated an overall higher cortical excitability in the JME patients, particularly over the anterior cortex after sleep deprivation and rebound sleep. This phenomenon could be related to the cortico-thalamic circuit dysfunctions believed to cause myoclonic epilepsy and a higher susceptibility of the frontal and prefrontal areas to the effects of sleep deprivation.  
33445687	Some Molecular and Cellular Stress Mechanisms Associated with Neurodegenerative Diseases and Atherosclerosis.	International journal of molecular sciences	2021	test	6	7	5	Some Molecular and Cellular Stress Mechanisms Associated with Neurodegenerative Diseases and Atherosclerosis.  Chronic stress is a combination of nonspecific adaptive reactions of the body to the influence of various adverse stress factors which disrupt its homeostasis, and it is also a corresponding state of the organism's nervous system (or the body in general). We hypothesized that chronic stress may be one of the causes occurence of several molecular and cellular types of stress. We analyzed literary sources and considered most of these types of stress in our review article. We examined genes and mutations of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes and also molecular variants which lead to various types of stress. The end result of chronic stress can be metabolic disturbance in humans and animals, leading to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress, energy deficiency in cells (due to a decrease in ATP synthesis) and mitochondrial dysfunction. These changes can last for the lifetime and lead to severe pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases and atherosclerosis. The analysis of literature allowed us to conclude that under the influence of chronic stress, metabolism in the human body can be disrupted, mutations of the mitochondrial and nuclear genome and dysfunction of cells and their compartments can occur. As a result of these processes, oxidative, genotoxic, and cellular stress can occur. Therefore, chronic stress can be one of the causes forthe occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases and atherosclerosis. In particular, chronic stress can play a large role in the occurrence and development of oxidative, genotoxic, and cellular types of stress.  
19187325	Relevance of the hygiene hypothesis to early vs. late onset allergic rhinitis.	Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology	2009	test	7	17	3	Relevance of the hygiene hypothesis to early vs. late onset allergic rhinitis.  INTRODUCTION: The hygiene hypothesis proposes that reduced exposure to infections in early life increases the risk of developing allergic conditions including allergic rhinitis. We examined the association between markers of the hygiene hypothesis and allergic rhinitis that developed before 7 years of age and allergic rhinitis that developed after 7 years of age. METHODS: The Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study (TAHS) is a population-based cohort (n=8583) study of respiratory disease. Participants have been followed from 7 to 44 years of age. Information on potential risk factors, allergies and respiratory symptoms was collected longitudinally. Using multi-nomial logistic regression, exposure to siblings, infections, tonsillectomy and farm residence during childhood were examined as risk factors for allergic rhinitis that developed before or after 7 years of age. All analyses were adjusted for gender, maternal and paternal atopy, mother's age at participant's birth, paternal socio-economic status in 1968 and personal socio-economic status in 2004. RESULTS: Greater cumulative exposure to siblings before the age of 2 years was strongly inversely associated with early onset allergic rhinitis (<1 year sib exposure: OR=0.6, 95% CI 0.3-1.0; 1-3 years sib exposure: OR=0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9; >3 years sib exposure: OR=0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.8) less so with later onset allergic rhinitis. The risk of early onset allergic rhinitis decreased with increasing viral infections (OR=0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9) during childhood. Having a tonsillectomy before 7 years of age increased the risk of early onset allergic rhinitis (OR=1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.5). None of these factors was associated with later onset allergic rhinitis. CONCLUSIONS: Exposures relevant to the hygiene hypothesis were important predictors for the development of early onset but less so for later onset allergic rhinitis. The exact mechanisms by which siblings and infections protect against allergic rhinitis are unclear. The stronger findings for earlier onset allergic rhinitis suggest that family structure and infections have most impact on disease risk in early life. Further research should focus on early onset allergic rhinitis when exploring causal explanations for any sibling effect.

In this study, we sought to elucidate the association between ALAN and prostate cancer in 27 districts within Gwangju City and urban and rural areas from South Jeolla Province in South Korea. We analyzed the correlation between ALAN and the incidence of a range of cancers by Poisson regression analysis, after adjustment for confounding risk factors, such as smoking, drinking, obesity, stress, air pollution (particulate matter <10 mum in diameter), urbanization (proportion of urbanized area), and the cancer screening rate. Interestingly, the incidence of prostate cancer was significantly associated with ALAN (risk ratio = 1.02, p = 0.0369) and urbanization (risk ratio = 1.06, p = 0.0055). In particular, comparing the prostate cancer incidence at 25% and 75% level of ALAN, the risk ratio was 1.726 (12.6 over 7.3, respectively). No significant association was observed between ALAN and other cancers, including stomach, esophageal, liver, pancreatic, laryngeal, lung and tracheal, bladder, and brain and central nervous system cancers, as well as lymphoma and multiple myeloma. In conclusion, this study shows that a high incidence of prostate cancer may be independently associated with light pollution and urbanization, which represent significant factors in the rapid process of industrialization of South Korea.  
32120249	Relationship between time-varying exposure to occupational noise and incident hypertension: A prospective cohort study.	International journal of hygiene and environmental health	2020	test	14	8	6	Relationship between time-varying exposure to occupational noise and incident hypertension: A prospective cohort study.  BACKGROUND: Exposure to occupational noise might increase the risk of hypertension. However, limited cohort studies have investigated the relationship between time-varying exposure to occupational noise and the development of hypertension. METHODS: We conducted a 17-year cohort study involving 2459 workers to assess the relationship between time-varying exposure to occupational noise and incident hypertension in the aerospace industry. We performed an extended Cox proportional hazard model considering occupational noise exposure as time-varying covariates. Furthermore, we employed the distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMS) to examine the exposure-response relationship. RESULTS: In the extended Cox proportional model, as workers were exposed to noise over 80 dBA, the hazard ratios (HRs) of hypertension significantly increased with a noise increase of 5 dBA (HR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04-1.29). In exposure-response associations, the HRs of hypertension steadily increased between noise levels of 82 and 106 dBA (HRs ranged from 1.04 to 1.46). After additionally adjusting for personal protection equipment (PPE), the HRs decreased dramatically between 107 and 124 dBA (HRs ranged from 1.45 to 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Our study refined the exposure assessment by integrating time-varying exposures to occupational noise and taking work history into consideration. Our findings suggested that workers exposed to noise levels between 82 and 106 dBA for 3-17 years may increase the risk of hypertension with a non-linear exposure-response pattern. We further provided evidence that workers wearing PPE could effectively reduce noise exposure and avoid the development of hypertension.  
18572104	Indoor combustion and asthma.	Immunology and allergy clinics of North America	2008	test	16	6	3	Indoor combustion and asthma.  Indoor combustion produces both gases (eg, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide) and particulate matter that may affect the development or exacerbation of asthma. Sources in the home include both heating devices (eg, fireplaces, woodstoves, kerosene heaters, flued [ie, vented] or nonflued gas heaters) and gas stoves for cooking. This article highlights the recent literature examining associations between exposure to indoor combustion and asthma development and severity. Since asthma is a chronic condition affecting both children and adults, both age groups are included in this article. Overall, there is some evidence of an association between exposure to indoor combustion and asthma, particularly asthma symptoms in children. Some sources of combustion such as coal stoves have been more consistently associated with these outcomes than other sources such as woodstoves.  
35641117	Spinning a global web: tactics used by Big Tobacco to attract children at tobacco points-of-sale.	Tobacco control	2023	test	20	0	0	Spinning a global web: tactics used by Big Tobacco to attract children at tobacco points-of-sale.  Most of the published literature on cigarette advertising and promotion at points-of-sale is on research conducted in high-income countries. We report findings from monitoring cigarette advertising and promotion at points-of-sale near schools and playgrounds in 42 countries, the majority low-income and middle-income. Four strategies were detected across most of these countries: (1) display of cigarettes near snacks, sweets and sugary drinks, (2) placement of cigarette advertisements near the eye-level of children, (3) advertisements and display of flavoured cigarettes and (4) sale of single sticks of cigarettes. These advertising and promotional tactics target children and youth and demonstrate that multinational tobacco companies use similar strategies to promote cigarettes at points-of-sale. The widespread violations of existing laws and regulations, the exploitation of regulatory loopholes and lack of existing tobacco control policies that apply to points-of-sale call for adoption and enactment of provisions recommended by the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control such as comprehensive bans on tobacco advertisement, promotion and sponsorship, bans on sale of single cigarette sticks and regulation of flavours. These strategies will help to protect children and youth from exposure to tobacco advertising.

Plant foods for human nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands)	1997	test	27	0	0	Jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis): nutrition related aspects and needed nutrition research.  The nutritional characteristics and food potentials of jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) have been reviewed. The bean is a good sources of protein, 23% to 34%, and carbohydrate 55%. It is also a good source of Ca, Zn, P, Mg, Cu and Ni. Jack bean protein is adequate in most essential amino acids with the exception of methionine and cystine which may be nutritionally limiting. Antinutritional and toxic factors including trypsin inhibitors, hemagglutinins, cyanogen glucosides, oligosaccharides and others are present in jack bean. Properly processed jack bean could be used to prepare some of the popular dishes made from cowpea, peanut, pigeon pea and soybean. Industrial products such as protein concentrates and isolates, starch, flakes, grits and flours can be produced from the bean. Further research is needed to identify varieties with high protein and nutritional quality. Development of new highly nutritious food products based on whole or processed jack bean should increase production and expand use.  
23725820	Integrating psychology and medicine in CPAP adherence--new concepts?	Sleep medicine reviews	2014	test	1	0	0	Integrating psychology and medicine in CPAP adherence--new concepts?  To date, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most effective intervention in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea, but adherence to this treatment is often less than optimal. A variety of factors and interventions that influence and improve CPAP use have been examined. There is increasing recognition of the multifaceted nature of CPAP adherence: the patient's psychological profile and social environment have been recognised, in addition to the more extensively researched patient's treatment and physiological profile. Understanding how these multiple factors impact on CPAP use in an integrative fashion might provide us with a useful holistic model of CPAP adherence. This concept of integration--a biopsychosocial (BPS) approach to health and illness--has previously been described to understand care provision for various chronic health disorders. This paper proposes an adherence framework, whereby variables integrally affect CPAP use. The BPS model has been considered for nearly 35 years; the presence of poor CPAP adherence was acknowledged in the early 1990s--it is timely to incorporate this approach into our care pathway of CPAP users.  
17426303	Treatment and awareness of type 2 diabetes in Beijing, China, compared to New York.	The Diabetes educator	2007	test	4	22	0	Treatment and awareness of type 2 diabetes in Beijing, China, compared to New York.  PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine awareness and treatment of type 2 diabetes among Beijingers. METHODS: Surveys generated in Mandarin and English were used to poll 75 Beijingers with type 2 diabetes, 29 Beijingers without diabetes, and 23 New Yorkers without diabetes. Beijing data were compared with diabetes statistics on exercise and blood glucose testing frequency from the 2002 New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Community Health Survey and the 2003, 2004, and 2005 New York State Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. RESULTS: The surveyed Beijingers with diabetes used primarily only Western pills to treat their type 2 diabetes, and a smaller percentage used traditional Chinese medicine. Most of the surveyed Beijingers with diabetes wrote that they exercised regularly. Most exercised at least 7 times per week. About half of the surveyed Beijingers with diabetes had no food restrictions. Virtually all of the surveyed Beijingers with diabetes tested their blood glucose, but approximately half of these individuals tested less than 1 time per week. Beijingers with diabetes were less aware than New York respondents who did not have diabetes of what diabetes is and the consequences of poor diabetes treatment. Beijingers who did not have diabetes were less aware than New Yorkers who did not have diabetes of what diabetesis, the symptoms, the causes, the treatments, and the consequences of poor diabetes treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that compared to New Yorkers with diabetes, Beijingers with diabetes tended to exercise much more frequently but tested their blood glucose less frequently. With the projected increase of type 2 diabetes in Beijing, more efforts need to be made to increase the frequency of blood glucose testing and basic diabetes awareness.

Journal of physical activity & health	2006	test	5	0	0	"An Exploratory Analysis of Adherence Patterns and Program Completion of a Pedometer-Based Physical Activity Intervention.  BACKGROUND: We examined participant characteristics related to pedometer program adherence and completion. METHODS: Participants (n = 177, age = 43 +/- 9 y, BMI = 29.5 +/- 6.2 kg/m(2)) were from sedentary workplaces. Baseline steps/day for women (n = 153) was 7230 +/- 3447 versus men (n = 24) 8265 +/- 2849 (P < 0.05). Records included pedometer use, days/week goals were achieved, and steps/day. Program completers (n = 104) fulfilled pre- and post-program assessments and at least 8 wk of recording. Non-completers (n = 53) met neither requirement, but pre-program data were available. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in sex, age, education, or time at work between completion strata. The only significant baseline difference was an initial ""worry about completing the program"" (completer < non-completer; P < 0.05). The pedometer-based program was most successful in increasing physical activity in overweight or class I obese individuals. Participants with lower baseline steps/day were also more likely to complete the program. CONCLUSION: The study findings have potential to inform effective health promotion planning.  "
14634166	Orthodontic and orthognathic management of a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta and dentinogenesis imperfecta: a case report.	Journal of orthodontics	2003	test	5	5	0	Orthodontic and orthognathic management of a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta and dentinogenesis imperfecta: a case report.  This case report describes a patient's severe Class III malocclusion, managed with a combination of orthodontic and orthognathic treatment. The medical history was complicated by osteogenesis imperfecta and dentinogenesis imperfecta. In addition the patient was a Jehovah's Witness. Patients with osteogenesis imperfecta carry an increased risk of perioperative haemorrhage, and this led to bimaxillary surgery being carried out as two discrete surgical episodes for the patient described. In addition, the risk of enamel fracture led to orthodontic bands being cemented on all teeth. In spite of the increased risks a successful outcome was achieved.  
16520670	Professional cleaning and asthma.	Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology	2006	test	9	11	4	Professional cleaning and asthma.  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent evidence on the effect of cleaning jobs on asthma, based on case reports and series of occupational asthma among cleaners, and epidemiological studies on the relationship between different characteristics of cleaning and asthma risk, as well as to elaborate the evidence on potential occupational exposures responsible for the increased asthma risk observed in cleaners. RECENT FINDINGS: Six recent epidemiologic studies strengthen the evidence that domestic and industrial cleaners are at higher risk of asthma compared with professional employees in Europe and the United States. These studies take into account individual confounders, such as age and cigarette smoking. This finding is supported by case reports and registry-based studies of occupational asthma. The studies and reports have identified some chemicals, such as bleach, as specific causes of asthma. Increased risk of asthma has also been related to some specific job tasks, such as cleaning windows and washing dishes. SUMMARY: Recent studies strengthen the evidence of an increased asthma risk among cleaners or individuals in other jobs in which they are involved in cleaning. Further research should be directed to elaborate how much of asthma is related to specific sensitization to certain chemicals and how much to airway inflammation induced by exposure to a mixture of irritants.  
24233430	Cognitive and behavioral therapies for pathological gambling.	Journal of gambling studies	1995	test	5	2	0	Cognitive and behavioral therapies for pathological gambling.  The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of behavioral and cognitive treatment approaches in the management of pathological gambling disorders. Disappointingly, the literature to date contains only one controlled outcome study in which two differing behavioral techniques were compared. Although research in general has focussed on identifying the nature of cognitive distortions in gambling, findings from these studies have not been systematically translated into treatment programs. It is concluded that methodological limitations including small sample size, absence of control groups, multiple concurrent interventions and poorly defined outcome criteria preclude conclusive statements to be drawn regarding the active ingredient of either behavioral or cognitive strategies. The program offered within the Impulse Disorders Research Centre is outlined.  
17116632	[Assessment of 24 years of infant growth monitoring in a rural area of Senegal (1969-1992)].	Sante (Montrouge, France)	2006	test	15	6	1	[Assessment of 24 years of infant growth monitoring in a rural area of Senegal (1969-1992)].  Undernutrition in young children in developing countries is associated with an increased risk of death. But in several studies, a decrease in mortality was not associated with any decrease in the prevalence of undernutrition. STUDY AREA: A rural population of Casamance (Senegal) has been under yearly demographic surveillance by The French National Institute of Demographic Studies (INED) since 1985. Between 1960-1964 and 1990-1994, under-5 and child (1-4 years) mortality rates dropped from 312 to 127 and from 201 to 68 per 1,000, respectively. Since 1961, French Catholic nuns who are also professional nurses have been in charge of a private village dispensary located in a rural area of Casamance. This dispensary delivers permanent, high quality service and is widely attended. GROWTH MONITORING PROGRAMME: A growth-monitoring programme, supported by Cathwell, was initiated in 1969 for 0-5-year-old children (0-3 from 1985). Children were weighed wearing light clothes to the nearest 10g. Weights were recorded in a register that also contained information concerning identity (name, sex, date of birth) and address. All weights were plotted on growth charts kept by the mothers. During the sessions, the nurses provided nutrition education messages (i.e., preparation of high-energy and nutrient-dense infant gruels using local foods), advice on illness management (oral rehydration during diarrhoea) and hygiene (well and water-jar disinfection, construction of pit-latrines), importance of vaccination. From 1975, they also distributed free chloroquine during the malaria transmission season (May-November) for prevention and early presumptive treatment. Most likely thanks to this programme, infant and child mortality reached a low level at the end of the 1980s. In 1990, plasmodium resistance to chloroquine appeared, increasing malaria mortality. METHODS: All weight measurements taken in 1969-1994 were entered into a database. This paper presents an analysis of weight measurements taken at 3-23 months of age from 1969-1992. A total of 4,636 infants were weighed at least once, but only 3,912 infants (1,983 boys and 1,929 girls) were available for the analysis, 724 being excluded due to missing data. RESULTS: The average coverage of the programme during the month of February was 88% for infants aged 3-23 months. Mean weight was examined at three target ages: 5, 11 and 15 months. Not only did the nutritional status not improve between 1969 and 1989, it even deteriorated in some years for all three age-cohorts. The nutritional status of infants in this community did not differ significantly from that of 12-23 month-old Senegalese children in the 1992-1993 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). Seasonal differences in mean weight and the prevalence of underweight became significant in the rainy season since 1975. Underweight for the 15-month-old children increased over time during the rainy season. These findings were unexpected, since malaria morbidity is thought to be at least partially responsible for seasonal variations in the nutritional status of young children, and despite the fact that the nurses began a malaria control programme in 1975. CONCLUSION: The rapid transition towards lower childhood mortality observed in this rural area of Casamance (Senegal), was not concomitant with any improvement in infants' nutritional status from 1969 through 1992. Focused public health interventions such as vaccinations and malaria prevention probably did not improve the nutritional status. Paradoxically, growth monitoring may have been more helpful in improving health than growth. Targeted specific nutritional interventions are needed to significantly improve growth of children in this community.  
20153884	Decreased severity of ovarian cancer and increased survival in hens fed a flaxseed-enriched diet for 1 year.	Gynecologic oncology	2010	test	15	10	5	Decreased severity of ovarian cancer and increased survival in hens fed a flaxseed-enriched diet for 1 year.  OBJECTIVE: With the exception of the laying hen, no other animal model of spontaneous ovarian surface epithelial cancer replicates the human disease. Flaxseed is the richest vegetable source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are chemopreventive in breast cancer and may be important in other cancers. The objective of this study was to determine if a flaxseed-enriched diet had a chemopreventive effect on ovarian cancer in the laying hen. METHODS: White Leghorn hens were fed with 10% flaxseed-enriched or standard diet for 1 year. The incidence and severity of ovarian cancer were determined by gross pathology and histology in the two groups. General health markers were also measured. Eggs were collected and analyzed by gas chromatography to determine omega-3 fatty acid levels. RESULTS: A significant reduction in late stage ovarian tumors was detected in the flaxseed-fed hens. Incidence rates of ovarian cancer were not significantly different between the two groups. The results indicate that a flaxseed diet increases overall survival in the laying hen. Flaxseed-fed hens' eggs incorporated significantly more omega-3 fatty acids compared to control hens. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that 10% flaxseed supplementation for 1 year in the laying hen results in a significant reduction in the severity of ovarian cancer, but no change in the incidence of the disease. Hens fed flaxseed had overall better health and reduced mortality. These findings may provide the basis for a clinical trial that evaluates the efficacy of flaxseed as a chemosuppressant of ovarian cancer in women.  
16120095	Effects of sleep deprivation on wound healing.	Journal of sleep research	2005	test	9	0	0	Effects of sleep deprivation on wound healing.  Sleep deprivation is widely regarded as a stressor and has been shown to have significant effects on host defences. Severely sleep-deprived rats develop lesions on their paws and tails, suggesting possible deficits in the healing process. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep deprivation (RSD) on wound healing in a rat model. Male dark-hooded Long-Evans rats, 2-4 months old, were subjected to dorsal application of two sterile punch biopsies, each 3.5 mm in size. Biopsies were performed either immediately before or immediately after 5 days of sleep deprivation. Wound healing in REM sleep-deprived animals was compared with home cage control and yoked control animals. RSD did not produce differences in the rate of healing, regardless of the timing of the biopsy punch. RSD does not appear to have significant effects on wound healing and thus appears to act differently from other types of stressors on wound healing.

Journal of dental hygiene : JDH	2001	test	4	1	0	Automated oral hygiene self-care devices: making evidence-based choices to improve client outcomes.  Dental hygienists have historically been the primary promoters of health, prevention, and wellness in dental practice. With the large number of automated self-care devices available, many clients expect their dental hygienists to be experts and advisors on such purchases. It is vitally important for dental hygienists to understand and evaluate the available clinical research findings, and along with their clients, apply them in a collaborative decision making process. The purpose of this course is for dental hygienists to learn the scientific and practical implications of evidence-based care in the selection of automated oral hygiene self-care devices. Measurable clinical outcomes in plaque removal, reduction in gingivitis, bleeding, probing depth, periodontal pathogens, and the role of inflammatory mediators will be discussed. Automated self-care products currently available will be identified. Successful completion of the course objectives will be assessed by a post-test, to be completed by the learner after reading the article in its entirety. Two hours of continuing education course credit will be awarded following successful completion of the post test.

Based on 339 cases this review identifies, quantifies and compares 4 clinical forms of recurrent hypersomnia (1) Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) (239 cases), (2) Kleine-Levin syndrome without compulsive eating (KLS WOCE) (54 cases), (3) Menstrual related hypersomnia (MRH) (18 cases) and Recurrent hypersomnia with comorbidity (RHC) (28 cases). A second part of the review considers the main current issues on recurrent hypersomnia: the predisposing factors, including a window on family cases; the pathophysiology based on clinical patterns, neuroimaging data, neuropathological examinations and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 measurements; the issues of recurrence and of a possible disruption of the circadian timing system; the relationships between recurrent hypersomnia and mood disorders; and a note on the atypical Kleine-Levin syndrome. The main outcomes of this study are a clear nosologic distinction of the different forms of recurrent hypersomnia, the finding that the prevalence of familial cases of KLS is in the same range as in narcolepsy, the suggestion of the possible involvement of a large set of cortical and subcortical structures in recurrent hypersomnia and some clues in favour of a relationship between recurrent hypersomnia and mood disorders.  
34595604	Sleep deprivation and quality of life among uterine cancer survivors: systematic review.	Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer	2022	test	14	15	2	Sleep deprivation and quality of life among uterine cancer survivors: systematic review.  INTRODUCTION: While cancer survival might be a relief from a near-death health condition, the after-recovery period also predisposes the survivors to deteriorated quality of life as well as sleep deprivation. Patients with cancer may experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) throughout the diagnostic process and even after diagnosis is completed, especially when facing the possibility of tumor recurrence. Survivors, in particular, are frequently in a condition of uncertainty due to the 15 to 20% chance of recurrence within 3 years of the main treatment. Despite the high rate of cancer survival, which is believed to be around 83%, assessing quality of life after a cancer diagnosis can help to improve such results. PURPOSE: This article aimed to describe the sleep patterns among uterine cancer survivors and verify psychological and physical factors affecting their general qualities of life. According to the qualitative study, uterine cancer survivors who receive treatment, whether pharmaceutical or therapeutic, have a higher quality of life than those who do not. METHOD: PRISMA reporting was used for this systematic review. Electronic databases that were searched include PubMed, Cochrane Trial Register, and ScienceDirect for studies evaluating the sleep deprivation and quality of life among uterine cancer survivors. Ten publications were chosen based on inclusion criteria that included uterine cancer survivors who had finished their treatments and addressed sleep quality or overall quality of life. RESULTS: The main finding of the systematic review is that 61% of uterine cancer survivors had poor sleep quality, and 81% have a decreased quality of life. CONCLUSION: According to the most recent research, uterine cancer survivors suffer from sleep deprivation, which leads to a lower quality of life. However, the same study reveals that uterine cancer survivors suffering with sleep loss use a variety of cognitive behavioral therapy to improve their quality of life. Maintaining a healthy diet, incorporating physical activity into daily routines, receiving cognitive behavior therapy, participating in relevant training programs, and obtaining frequent depression and sexual health screenings are just a few of the CBT mechanisms mentioned.  
32919449	Role and Prognosis of Extracorporeal Life Support in Patients Who Develop Cardiac Arrest during or after Office-Based Cosmetic Surgery.	The Korean journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery	2020	test	6	6	4	Role and Prognosis of Extracorporeal Life Support in Patients Who Develop Cardiac Arrest during or after Office-Based Cosmetic Surgery.  Background: Cardiac arrest during or after office-based cosmetic surgery is rare, and little is known about its prognosis. We assessed the clinical outcomes of patients who developed cardiac arrest during or after cosmetic surgery at office-based clinics. Methods: Between May 2009 and May 2016, 32 patients who developed cardiac arrest during or after treatment at cosmetic surgery clinics were consecutively enrolled. We compared clinical outcomes, including complications, between survivors (n=19) and non-survivors (n=13) and attempted to determine the prognostic factors of mortality. Results: All 32 of the patients were female, with a mean age of 30.40+/-11.87 years. Of the 32 patients, 13 (41%) died. Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) was applied in a greater percentage of non-survivors than survivors (92.3% vs. 47.4%, respectively; p=0.009). The mean duration of in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was longer for the non-survivors than the survivors (31.55+/-33 minutes vs. 7.59+/-9.07 minutes, respectively; p=0.01). The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score was also higher among non-survivors than survivors (23.85+/-6.68 vs. 16.79+/-7.44, respectively; p=0.01). No predictor of death was identified in the patients for whom ECLS was applied. Of the 19 survivors, 10 (52.6%) had hypoxic brain damage, and 1 (5.3%) had permanent lower leg ischemia. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the estimated glomerular filtration rate was a predictor of mortality. Conclusion: Patients who developed cardiac arrest during or after cosmetic surgery at office-based clinics experienced poor prognoses, even though ECLS was applied in most cases. The survivors suffered serious complications. Careful monitoring of subjects and active CPR (when necessary) in cosmetic surgery clinics may be essential.  
33990187	The association between ambient air pollution and birth defects in five major ethnic groups in Liuzhou, China.	BMC pediatrics	2021	test	22	25	20	The association between ambient air pollution and birth defects in five major ethnic groups in Liuzhou, China.  BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that exposure to ambient air pollution during pregnancy may be associated with increased risks of birth defects (BDs), but conclusions have been inconsistent. This study describes the ethnic distribution of major BDs and examines the relationship between air pollution and BDs among different ethnic groups in Liuzhou city, China. METHODS: Surveillance data of infants born in 114 registered hospitals in Liuzhou in 2019 were analyzed to determine the epidemiology of BDs across five major ethnic groups. Concentrations of six air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, O3) were obtained from the Liuzhou Environmental Protection Bureau. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations between ambient air pollution exposure and risk of BDs. RESULTS: Among 32,549 infants, 635 infants had BDs, yielding a prevalence of 19.5 per 1000 perinatal infants. Dong ethnic group had the highest prevalence of BDs (2.59%), followed by Yao (2.57%), Miao (2.35%), Zhuang (2.07%), and Han (1.75%). Relative to the Han ethnic group, infants from Zhuang, Miao, Yao and Dong groups had lower risks of congenital heart disease, polydactyly, and hypospadias. The Zhuang ethnic group had higher risks of severe thalassemia, cleft lip and/or palate, and syndactyls. Overall BDs were positively correlated with air pollutants PM10 (aOR =1.14, 95% CI:1.12 ~ 2.43; aOR =1.51, 95% CI:1.13 ~ 2.03 for per 10mug/mg3 increment) and CO (aOR =1.36, 95% CI:1.14 ~ 2.48; aOR =1.75, 95% CI:1.02 ~ 3.61 for every 1 mg /m3 increment) in second and third month of pregnancy. SO2 was also significantly associated with BDs in the second month before the pregnancy (aOR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.20 ~ 3.22) and third month of pregnancy (aOR =1.75; 95% CI:1.02 ~ 3.61). Congenital heart disease, polydactyl, cleft lip and/or palate were also significantly associated with PM10, SO2 and CO exposures. However, no significant association was found between birth defects and O3, PM2.5 and NO2 exposures (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study provides a comprehensive description of ethnic differences in BDs in Southwest China and broadens the evidence of the association between air pollution exposure during gestation and BDs.  
19219612	Impact of marital status in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.	World journal of urology	2009	test	23	9	1	Impact of marital status in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.  PURPOSE: Married (vs. unmarried) individuals have improved health status and longer life expectancies in a variety of benign and malignant disease states, including prostate, breast, head/neck, and lung cancers. We sought to evaluate a cohort of patients undergoing cystectomy for bladder cancer to evaluate the impact of marital status on demographic, peri-operative, and pathological outcomes in order to better understand the factors which may contribute to the survival differences observed. METHODS: Two-hundred and two patients underwent radical cystectomy and urinary diversion for bladder cancer. Patients were categorized based on marital status as either married or unmarried (widowed, divorced, never married). Correlations were made to demographic factors (age, race, gender, BMI, tobacco use, alcohol use), perioperative factors (pre-op renal function (creatinine), hematocrit, EBL, hospital stay, choice of diversion), and pathological outcomes (organ-confined status, LN positivity). RESULTS: Of the 202 patients, 74% were married. Married individuals (vs. unmarried) were more often male (84 vs. 62%) and had a higher BMI (28.1 vs. 25.9). Married persons had a significantly lower pre-op creatinine (1.1 vs. 1.4) and higher hematocrit (39 vs. 34). Hospital stay was shorter in married patients by a mean of 1.6 days. Regarding operative pathology, married patients had a higher rate of organ-confined disease (59 vs. 47%) (P = 0.05, 0.08 on multivariate) and trended towards a lower rate of LN positivity (15 vs. 21%; P = 0.10, 0.12 multivariate). CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing cystectomy for bladder cancer, married individuals appear to have improved pre-operative laboratory variables, shorter hospitalization, and improved pathological outcomes versus unmarried patients in our case series. These findings may support the evidence (observed in other tumor types and other disease states) that married persons present earlier than unmarried individuals, and this may help explain the improved survival outcomes that have been observed in married patients with bladder cancer.  
33781033	[High frequency hearing loss detection rate in occupational noise exposed workers in China: a Meta-analysis].	Zhonghua lao dong wei sheng zhi ye bing za zhi = Zhonghua laodong weisheng zhiyebing zazhi = Chinese journal of industrial hygiene and occupational diseases	2021	test	9	9	3	[High frequency hearing loss detection rate in occupational noise exposed workers in China: a Meta-analysis].  Objective: A Meta-analysis was used to evaluate the high frequency hearing loss detection rate, its area and time distributions in occupational noise exposed workers in China to provide evidence for the prevention and control of occupational noise-induced deafness. Methods: From February to April 2020, the number of hearing tests and the number of binaural high frequency average hearing threshold >=40 dB of workers exposed to noise in key occupational disease monitoring and occupational health risk assessment project in China was collected from China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) , VIP database and PubMed database. The retrieval time was set from the establishment of the database to February 28, 2020. The R 3.6.2 software was used to calculate the pooled high frequency hearing loss detection rate. Results: A total of 28 studies, included 34 data and 1259571 occupational noise exposed workers, were enrolled. The articles covered 16 provinces in 2015-2018. The pooled high frequency hearing loss detection rate in occupational noise exposed workers was 9.45% (95%CI: 7.64%-11.64%) . The high frequency hearing loss detection rate (10.54%) was higher in 2018 than other years (2017: 10.17%, 2016: 9.21%, 2015: 7.88%) . The high frequency hearing loss detection rate (12.23%) was higher in central China than in eastern (10.21%) , western (7.91%) and north-eastern (5.21%) China. Conclusion: The overall high frequency hearing loss detection rate in occupational noise exposed workers is generally high in China. It is important to strengthen the hearing protection in occupational noise exposed workers to facilitate the occupational noise-induced deafness prevention and control in China.  
9777681	Strength training. Single versus multiple sets.	Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)	1998	test	8	0	0	Strength training. Single versus multiple sets.  Perhaps the most controversial element of any strength training programme is the number of sets required to increase muscular strength and hypertrophy. There is a prevalent belief that at least 3 sets of each exercise are required to elicit optimal increases in strength and hypertrophy. However, most of the studies that reported the results of training with single versus multiple sets do not substantiate this tenet. In fact, the preponderance of evidence suggests that for training durations of 4 to 25 weeks there is no significant difference in the increase in strength or hypertrophy as a result of training with single versus multiple sets. Because of the design limitations of these studies, conclusions concerning the efficacy of multiple sets should be tentative. However, there is little scientific evidence, and no theoretical physiological basis, to suggest that a greater volume of exercise elicits greater increases in strength or hypertrophy. This information may represent an important practical application of time-efficient, low-volume exercise.  
30820415	Premarital Screening and Genetic Counseling Program: Studies from an Endogamous Population.	International journal of applied & basic medical research	2019	test	8	8	0	Premarital Screening and Genetic Counseling Program: Studies from an Endogamous Population.  Background: Studies in Arab countries have shown a significant lack of knowledge of Premarital Screening and Genetic Counseling (PMSGC) Program. PMSGC can identify and modify, through prevention and management, some behavioral, medical, and other health risk factors known to impact pregnancy outcomes. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the knowledge, attitudes, and practice of Qatari's toward the premarital screening program and shedding more light on a complex matter. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study based on Hospitals and Primary Health Care Centers. A total sample of 1246 participants was surveyed, and 873 participants (70.0%) expressed their consent to participate in the study during January 2013-May 2014. The questionnaire based on sociodemographic data and for responses, on the PMSGC program knowledge, attitude, and practice statements. In addition, questions were asked regarding the services, activities, and how to attract and motivate the PMSGC program. Results: The mean age and standard deviation (SD) of the males' age were 30.4 +/- 6.50 and the mean and SD of females' age were 31.08 +/- 5.98. There were statistically significant differences between males and females with regard to age, educational status, occupation status, household income, consanguinity, body mass index, cigarette smoking, and Shisha smoking. There were no any statistically significant differences between males and females regarding sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency cystic fibrosis, homocystinuria, HIV, and hepatitis. The response to the ''Why proceeding through high-risk marriage?'' by gender, males and females responded statistically significant differences (P = 0.019). The step-wise multivariate regression analyses as predictors for knowledge of PMSGC program revealed that age, educational level, the lack knowledge of genetics counseling, parental interventions for cousin marriage decision, positive test results affect and change marriage decision, religious impact, household income, consanguinity, hereditary diseases knowledge, occupational status, and love factors were considered as the main factors associated with the premarriage screening and genetics counseling after adjusting for age, gender, and other variables. Conclusion: The current study revealed that knowledge and attitude regarding PMSGC program were low in population. Motivation, enforcement, and implementation of program at the school and university educational campaigns are vital. Improved counseling and adding new topics for counseling on genetic, chronic, and mental illness; building healthy families; and reproduction and fertility are considered to be top priorities in community.  
29260596	Transverse myelitis following methotrexate treatment of ectopic pregnancy: a case report.	The European journal of contraception & reproductive health care : the official journal of the European Society of Contraception	2017	test	0	5	0	Transverse myelitis following methotrexate treatment of ectopic pregnancy: a case report.  OBJECTIVE: Ectopic pregnancy is a common condition in the field of gynaecology, often treated with methotrexate. Adverse effects are common and usually mild. Severe adverse events are rare amongst patients treated with MTX for this condition. CASE: A 26-year-old healthy woman was admitted and treated medically with MTX for an ectopic pregnancy. The patient was treated in the standard drug labelled protocol with an intramuscular injection of 78 mg of MTX according to body surface area. Soon after, the patient presented to the emergency department with symptoms of bilateral paresthesia of the lower limbs which ascended to the pelvis. After a thorough work up and imaging via MRI a diagnosis of transverse myelitis was made. Treatment was successful with corticosteroids and symptoms subsided. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that MTX should be used with caution and severe toxicity should be kept in mind with high index of awareness for any symptom development following treatment, especially neurological one.  
23876569	Effects of meditation on anxiety, depression, fatigue, and quality of life of women undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer.	Complementary therapies in medicine	2013	test	7	11	2	Effects of meditation on anxiety, depression, fatigue, and quality of life of women undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer.  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of meditation on anxiety, depression, fatigue, and quality of life in women who are receiving radiation therapy for breast cancer. DESIGN: Randomized, non-program controlled, parallel intervention clinical trial. SETTING: The ASAN Cancer Center located in Seoul, Korea. INTERVENTION: The subjects of this study included 102 female breast cancer patients who had undergone breast-conserving surgery; these female patients were randomized into equally assigned meditation control groups, with each group consisting of 51 patients. The test group received a total of 12 meditation therapy sessions during their 6-week radiation therapy period, and the control group underwent only a conventional radiation therapy. OUTCOME: The tools used to evaluate the effects of meditation were Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, Revised Piper Fatigue scale, and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Core-30. The results were analyzed based on the principles of intention-to-treat analysis, and, as a corollary analysis, per-protocol analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The breast cancer patients who received meditation therapy compared with the non-intervention group saw improvements in reduction of anxiety (p=.032), fatigue (p=.030), and improvement in global quality of life (p=.028). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, an affirmation can be made that meditation can be used as a non-invasive intervention treatment for improving fatigue, anxiety, quality of life, and emotional faculties of women with breast cancer.  
28164449	Role of sleep and circadian disruption on energy expenditure and in metabolic predisposition to human obesity and metabolic disease.	Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity	2017	test	26	6	7	Role of sleep and circadian disruption on energy expenditure and in metabolic predisposition to human obesity and metabolic disease.  Weight gain, obesity and diabetes have reached alarming levels in the developed world. Traditional risk factors such as over-eating, poor nutritional choices and lack of exercise cannot fully account for the high prevalence of metabolic disease. This review paper examines the scientific evidence on two novel risk factors that contribute to dys-regulated metabolic physiology: sleep disruption and circadian misalignment. Specifically, fundamental relationships between energy metabolism and sleep and circadian rhythms and the impact of sleep and circadian disruption on metabolic physiology are examined. Millions of individuals worldwide do not obtain sufficient sleep for healthy metabolic function, and many participate in shift work and social activities at times when the internal physiological clock is promoting sleep. These behaviours predispose an individual for poor metabolic health by promoting excess caloric intake in response to reduced sleep, food intake at internal biological times when metabolic physiology is not prepared, decreased energy expenditure when wakefulness and sleep are initiated at incorrect internal biological times, and disrupted glucose metabolism during short sleep and circadian misalignment. In addition to the traditional risk factors of poor diet and exercise, disturbed sleep and circadian rhythms represent modifiable risk factors for prevention and treatment of metabolic disease and for promotion of healthy metabolism.  
29735749	Examining lung cancer risks across different industries and occupations in Ontario, Canada: the establishment of the Occupational Disease Surveillance System.	Occupational and environmental medicine	2018	test	4	7	0	Examining lung cancer risks across different industries and occupations in Ontario, Canada: the establishment of the Occupational Disease Surveillance System.  BACKGROUND: The Occupational Disease Surveillance System (ODSS) was established in Ontario, Canada by linking a cohort of workers with data created from Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) claims to administrative health databases. The aim of this study was to use ODSS to identify high-risk industry and occupation groups for lung cancer in Ontario. METHODS: Workers in the WSIB lost time claims database were linked to the Ontario Cancer Registry using subjects' health insurance numbers, name, sex, birthdate and death date (if applicable). Several occupations and industries known to be at increased risk were outlined a priori to examine whether ODSS could replicate these associations. Age-adjusted, sex-stratified Cox proportional hazard models compared the risk of lung cancer within one industry/occupation versus all other groups in the cohort. Workers with a lung cancer diagnosis prior to cohort entry were excluded for analysis, leaving 2 187 762 workers for analysis. RESULTS: During the 1983 to 2014 follow-up, 34 661 workers in the cohort were diagnosed with lung cancer. Among expected high-risk industries, elevated risks were observed among workers in quarries/sand pits and construction industries for both sexes, and among males in metal mines, iron foundries, non-metallic mineral products industries and transportation industries. Excess risk was also observed among occupations in drilling/blasting, other mining/quarrying, mineral ore treating, excavating/grading/paving, truck driving, painting, bus driving and construction. CONCLUSIONS: This current surveillance system identified several established high-risk groups for lung cancer and could be used for ongoing surveillance of occupational lung cancer in Ontario.  
34084981	Exploration of the Global Burden of Dementia Attributable to PM2.5: What Do We Know Based on Current Evidence?	GeoHealth	2021	test	10	6	3	Exploration of the Global Burden of Dementia Attributable to PM2.5: What Do We Know Based on Current Evidence?  Exposure to ambient PM2.5 pollution has been linked to multiple adverse health effects. Additional effects have been identified in the literature and there is a need to understand its potential role in high prevalence diseases. In response to recent indications of PM2.5 as a risk factor for dementia, we examine the evidence by systematically reviewing the epidemiologic literature, in relation to exposure from ambient air pollution, household air pollution, secondhand smoke, and active smoking. We develop preliminary exposure-response functions, estimate the uncertainty, and discuss sensitivities and model selection. We estimate the likely impact to be 2.1 M (1.4 M, 2.5 M; 5%-95% confidence) global incident dementia cases and 0.6 M (0.4 M, 0.8 M) deaths attributable to ambient PM2.5 pollution in 2015. This implies a combined toll from morbidity and mortality of dementia of 7.3 M (5.0 M, 9.1 M) lost disability-adjusted life years. China, Japan, India, and the United States had the highest estimated total burden, and the per capita burden was highest in developed countries with large elderly populations. Compared to 2000, most countries in Europe, the Americas, and Southern Africa reduced the burden in 2015, while other regions had a net increase. Based on a recent systematic review of cost of illness studies for dementia, our estimates imply economic costs of US$ 26 billion worldwide in 2015. Based on this estimation, ambient PM2.5 pollution may be responsible for 15% of premature deaths and 7% of DALYs associated with dementia. Our estimates also indicate substantial uncertainty in this relationship, and future epidemiological studies at high exposure levels are especially needed.  
29150201	Nations within a nation: variations in epidemiological transition across the states of India, 1990-2016 in the Global Burden of Disease Study.	Lancet (London, England)	2017	test	3	22	1	Nations within a nation: variations in epidemiological transition across the states of India, 1990-2016 in the Global Burden of Disease Study.  BACKGROUND: 18% of the world's population lives in India, and many states of India have populations similar to those of large countries. Action to effectively improve population health in India requires availability of reliable and comprehensive state-level estimates of disease burden and risk factors over time. Such comprehensive estimates have not been available so far for all major diseases and risk factors. Thus, we aimed to estimate the disease burden and risk factors in every state of India as part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2016. METHODS: Using all available data sources, the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative estimated burden (metrics were deaths, disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs], prevalence, incidence, and life expectancy) from 333 disease conditions and injuries and 84 risk factors for each state of India from 1990 to 2016 as part of GBD 2016. We divided the states of India into four epidemiological transition level (ETL) groups on the basis of the ratio of DALYs from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNNDs) to those from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries combined in 2016. We assessed variations in the burden of diseases and risk factors between ETL state groups and between states to inform a more specific health-system response in the states and for India as a whole. FINDINGS: DALYs due to NCDs and injuries exceeded those due to CMNNDs in 2003 for India, but this transition had a range of 24 years for the four ETL state groups. The age-standardised DALY rate dropped by 36.2% in India from 1990 to 2016. The numbers of DALYs and DALY rates dropped substantially for most CMNNDs between 1990 and 2016 across all ETL groups, but rates of reduction for CMNNDs were slowest in the low ETL state group. By contrast, numbers of DALYs increased substantially for NCDs in all ETL state groups, and increased significantly for injuries in all ETL state groups except the highest. The all-age prevalence of most leading NCDs increased substantially in India from 1990 to 2016, and a modest decrease was recorded in the age-standardised NCD DALY rates. The major risk factors for NCDs, including high systolic blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, high total cholesterol, and high body-mass index, increased from 1990 to 2016, with generally higher levels in higher ETL states; ambient air pollution also increased and was highest in the low ETL group. The incidence rate of the leading causes of injuries also increased from 1990 to 2016. The five leading individual causes of DALYs in India in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, and cerebrovascular disease; and the five leading risk factors for DALYs in 2016 were child and maternal malnutrition, air pollution, dietary risks, high systolic blood pressure, and high fasting plasma glucose. Behind these broad trends many variations existed between the ETL state groups and between states within the ETL groups. Of the ten leading causes of disease burden in India in 2016, five causes had at least a five-times difference between the highest and lowest state-specific DALY rates for individual causes. INTERPRETATION: Per capita disease burden measured as DALY rate has dropped by about a third in India over the past 26 years. However, the magnitude and causes of disease burden and the risk factors vary greatly between the states. The change to dominance of NCDs and injuries over CMNNDs occurred about a quarter century apart in the four ETL state groups. Nevertheless, the burden of some of the leading CMNNDs continues to be very high, especially in the lowest ETL states. This comprehensive mapping of inequalities in disease burden and its causes across the states of India can be a crucial input for more specific health planning for each state as is envisioned by the Government of India's premier think tank, the National Institution for Transforming India, and the National Health Policy 2017.

34787341	The mediating role of perceived social support in the relationship between morningness-eveningness and subjective well-being.	Journal of sleep research	2022	test	5	0	0	The mediating role of perceived social support in the relationship between morningness-eveningness and subjective well-being.  Studies show that morningness preference and subjective well-being are positively related. However, little is known about potential factors that may underpin this association. In the present study, we explored the mediational role of general social support and its facets (family, friends, and significant other) in the relationship between morningness-eveningness and subjective well-being. The present study was conducted with a sample of 1,067 adults (51% women), with a mean (SD, range) age of 36.41 (9.95, 18-55) years. Our results corroborated earlier findings that morningness was positively associated with both subjective well-being and social support. Controlling for age and gender, we obtained significant mediation effects, showing that the association between morningness-eveningness and subjective well-being might stem, at least in part, from the higher levels of social support received by morning-oriented individuals. This may lead to the conclusion that social support is an important antecedent of the greater well-being reported by morning-oriented individuals.  
11467260	The Masterson Approach with play therapy: a parallel process between mother and child.	American journal of psychotherapy	2001	test	5	1	0	The Masterson Approach with play therapy: a parallel process between mother and child.  This paper discusses a case in which the Masterson Approach was used with play therapy to treat a child with a developing personality disorder. It describes the parallel progression of the child and mother in adjunct therapy throughout a six-year period. The unique value of the Masterson Approach is that it provides the therapist with a framework and tool to diagnose and treat a child during the dynamic process of play. The case describes the mother-child dyad throughout therapy. It traces their parallel processes that involve separation, individuation, rapprochement, and the recovery of real self-capacities. Each stage of treatment is described, including verbal interventions. The child's internal affective state and intrapsychic structure during the various stages of treatment are illustrated by representative pictures.

One key factor in the economic lingual treatment concept presented in this series of articles is the use of prefabricated, customized nickel titanium arch wires with superelasticity and temperature-dependent spring-back qualities (memory effect). Using a modern, e-modulus driven archwire sequence, a non-extraction case can be treated with 1 or 2 wires per arch, and an extraction case with 2 or 3 wires per arch. This article, the last in the Lingual Orthodontics series, uses clinical examples to show the various clinical potentials of these wires with temperature-dependent superelasticity, as not only part of but occasionally all the treatment is done with these prefabricated, customized nickel titanium wires.  
18229663	The sleep habits and sleep disorders in children with headache.	Advances in medical sciences	2007	test	16	8	5	The sleep habits and sleep disorders in children with headache.  PURPOSE: The study was conducted to examine the sleep habits and sleep disorders in children and adolescents with headache. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three hundred children with headache were qualified to a headache group (HG) and 284 children from schools and kindergartens without headache to a control group (CG). RESULTS: In our study, 27.7% children of the HG slept together with other person in the bed; 18.7% of the CG. In the HG, 11.7% of children had physical contact with parents when falling asleep, in the CG 19.7%. In the HG, watching TV and listening to the radio when falling asleep occurred more frequently. About 20% of parents in the HG read aloud to children before putting them to sleep, in the CG 32.4%. Day naps occurred in 32.7% of the HG children and in 20.1% of the CG. Sleep disorders reported in the study group as parasomnia symptoms included: sleep talking 48.3% (CG 38.7%); bruxism 23.3% (CG 16.5%); leg movement 20.3% (CG 18.0%); nightmares 16.7% (CG 7.4%) and sleep breathing disorder symptoms like snoring 27.3% in the HG group (CG 19.0%) and breathing pauses 5.7% (CG 1.4%). Awakenings from the night sleep were observed in 43.7% children of the HG and in 36.4% children of the CG. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep habits in children with headache were considerably different from sleep habits in the CG. The prevalence of sleep disorder symptoms like: snoring, sleep talking, bruxism, sleep terror, nightmares, breathing pauses and awaking from night sleep was higher in the HG group than in the CG.  
23372900	The effect of probiotics on prevention of common cold: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial studies.	Korean journal of family medicine	2013	test	13	10	6	The effect of probiotics on prevention of common cold: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial studies.  BACKGROUND: Probiotics are currently under focus for their immune improvement function. Many studies have been performed to assess the potential efficacy of probiotics in allergic disease, viral disease, respiratory disease, as well as gastrointestinal disease. This study performed a systematic review to determine the effects of probiotics on the prevention of the common cold. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL for studies released through June 2011. Two authors independently extracted the data. To assess the risk of bias of included literatures, Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool was used. RESULTS: We identified 10 studies in 7 articles. A total 2,894 participants, 1,588 in the probiotics group and 1,306 in the control group, were included. The effect of probiotics on the prevention of the common cold had a relative risk (RR) of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.00, I(2) = 26%). In the subgroup analysis, the RR of administration of probiotics for 3 months or less was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.97). The RR of administration of probiotics over 3 months was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.92 to 1.09). The RR of administration of probiotics without any active intervention (vitamin and mineral) was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.97). CONCLUSION: In this meta-analysis, there was marginal effect of probiotics on the prevention of the common cold. The results implied that probiotics had a modest effect in common cold reduction. The balance of benefit and harms needs to be considered when using probiotics for common cold prevention.  
33063173	ADHD subtypes are associated differently with circadian rhythms of motor activity, sleep disturbances, and body mass index in children and adolescents: a case-control study.	European child & adolescent psychiatry	2021	test	14	18	5	ADHD subtypes are associated differently with circadian rhythms of motor activity, sleep disturbances, and body mass index in children and adolescents: a case-control study.  To date, few studies have examined the circadian pattern of motor activity in children and adolescents newly diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The objective was to study the circadian pattern of motor activity in subjects with ADHD (medication naive) and to investigate the relationships between alterations in circadian patterns, the ADHD subtype (combined or inattentive), sleep disturbances and body mass index (BMI). One-hundred twenty children and adolescents (60 medication naive ADHD and 60 controls) were included in a gender- and age-matched case-control study. ADHD was diagnosed according to the DSM-IV-TR, the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version, and the Conner's Parents Rating Scale-Revised. Circadian rhythms of motor activity and sleep parameters were measured using actigraphy and the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. BMI and dietary intake were also evaluated. ADHD patients showed a trend towards eveningness and greater sleep disturbances than controls. Additionally, patients with ADHD-combined had significantly higher mean values of motor activity and showed a significant delay in bedtime. Furthermore, among ADHD-C patients hyperactivity symptoms were significantly associated with the least 5 h of activity. Regarding patients with ADHD-inattentive, increased fragmentation of the circadian pattern was associated with inattention symptoms, and they also showed a significant increase in BMI of 2.52 kg/m(2) [95% CI 0.31, 4.73] in comparison with controls. Our findings highlight the potential use of actigraphy as a clinical tool to aid in the diagnosis of ADHD. It should be noted that evaluating motor activity variables could also allow the differentiation between ADHD subtypes.  
28057042	Prevalence and factors associated with overweight and obesity among private kindergarten school children in Bahirdar Town, Northwest Ethiopia: cross-sectional study.	BMC research notes	2017	test	20	9	2	"Prevalence and factors associated with overweight and obesity among private kindergarten school children in Bahirdar Town, Northwest Ethiopia: cross-sectional study.  BACKGROUND: In Sub-Saharan Africa, most nutrition efforts have concentrated on under-nutrition in children. However, national surveys rarely report the high prevalence of overweight and obesity among children. Likewise, in Ethiopia there is growing recognition of the emergence of a ""double-burden"" of malnutrition, with under and over nutrition occurring simultaneously among children, especially allied with improvements in socio-economic conditions. Hence, the study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with overweight and obesity among private kindergarten school children aged 3-6 years in Bahirdar town, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A school-based cross sectional study was conducted in Bahirdar Town, northwest Ethiopia from August to September, 2015. Anthropometric measurements such as weight and height were taken from 462 private Kindergarten preschool children aged 3-6 years; socio-economic and demographic factors and feeding practices were collected by interviewing the, mothers or caregivers of the children. The z-score values for BMI-for-age of children were generated using Emergency Nutrition Assessment (ENA) for Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief Transitions (SMART) 2011. Binary logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with overweight and obesity in children. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated to show the strength of association. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of overweight and obesity was 6.9% [95% CI 2.4, 11.4]. The prevalence of overweight and obesity were 4.1 and 2.8%, respectively. The odds of overweight and obesity was higher among children with high dietary diversity score (DDS) [AOR = 5.12, 95% CI 1.42, 18.47], family size of less than five [AOR = 4.76, 95% CI 1.84, 12.31] and a family having a private car [AOR = 3.43, 95% CI 1.02, 11.49]. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of overweight and obesity among private kindergarten preschool children in the study area was high. Interventions on improving feeding practice and doing physical activities are important for the control of overweight and obesity among children in urban settings.  "
21235764	Parental occupational exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals and male genital malformations: a study in the Danish National Birth Cohort study.	Environmental health : a global access science source	2011	test	11	8	4	Parental occupational exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals and male genital malformations: a study in the Danish National Birth Cohort study.  BACKGROUND: Sex hormones closely regulate development of the male genital organs during fetal life. The hypothesis that xenobiotics may disrupt endogenous hormonal signalling has received considerable scientific attention, but human evidence is scarce. OBJECTIVES: We analyse occurrence of hypospadias and cryptorchidism according to maternal and paternal occupational exposure to possible endocrine disrupting chemicals. METHODS: We conducted a follow-up study of 45,341 male singleton deliveries in the Danish National Birth Cohort during 1997-2009. Information on work during pregnancy was obtained by telephone interviews around gestational week 16. Parents' job titles were classified according to DISCO-88. A job exposure matrix for endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) was implemented to assess occupational exposures. The Medical Birth and National Hospital Register provided data on congenital anomalies diagnosed at birth or during follow-up, which ended in 2009. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were obtained from Cox regression models. RESULTS: Among all pregnancies, 6.3% were classified as possibly or probably exposed to EDCs. The most prevalent occupations conferring possible exposure were cleaners, laboratory technicians, hairdressers and agricultural workers (58% of all potentially exposed). The final cumulative incidence of cryptorchidism in boys was 2.2% (1002 cases), and of hypospadias 0.6% (262 cases). The occurrence of hypospadias increased when mothers were probably [HRa = 1.8 (95% CI 1.0-2.6)] or possibly exposed to one or more EDCs [HRa = 2.6 (95% CI 1.8-3.4). Possible paternal exposure to heavy metals increased the risk of hypospadias [HRa 2.2 (95% CI: 1.0-3.4)] and cryptorchidism [HRa 1.9 (95% CI: 1.1-2.7)]. None of the exposure groups reached statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The study provides some but limited evidence that occupational exposure to possible endocrine disrupting chemicals during pregnancy increases the risk of hypospadias.

The relationship between shift work and overweight/obesity in the male steel workers were analyzed by using logistic regression model and restricted cubic splinemodel. Results: A total of 7 262 male steel workers were surveyed, the overall prevalence of overweight/obesitywas 64.5% (4 686/7 262), the overweight rate was 34.3% and the obesity rate was 30.2%, respectively. After adjusting for age, educational level and average family income level per month by multivariable logistic regression analysis, shift work was associated with overweight/obesity and obesity in the male steel workers. The OR was 1.19(95% CI: 1.05-1.35) and 1.15(95% CI: 1.00-1.32). Restricted cubic spline model analysis showed that the relationship between shift work years and overweight/obesity in the male steel workers was a nonlinear dose response one (nonlinear test chi(2)=7.43, P<0.05). Restricted cubic spline model analysis showed that the relationship between shift work years and obesity in the male steel workers was a nonlinear dose response one (nonlinear test chi(2)=10.48, P<0.05). Conclusion: Shift work was associated with overweight and obesity in the male steel workers, and shift work years and overweight/obesity had a nonlinear relationship.  
33082987	The mediating role of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the association between obesity and problematic social media use in young adults.	Obesity science & practice	2020	test	10	14	8	The mediating role of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the association between obesity and problematic social media use in young adults.  Background: Obesity has been associated with problematic internet use or internet use characterized by impulsivity, dependence, risk taking or impairment. Despite the unique affordances and growing popularity of social media, few studies have investigated obesity in relation to the problematic use of social media in contrast to general internet use. Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between obesity and problematic social media use and to test symptoms of anxiety and depression as potential mediators of this relationship. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was administered to young adults between the ages of 18-25 using the Qualtrics platform. Two mediation models were tested using model 4 of the PROCESS Macro in SPSS. Results: Participants (n = 4939) were between the ages of 18-25 (M = 21.74, SD = 2.3). Participants were 50.6% female (n = 2496) and 58.1% White (n = 2871). Reporting obesity was positively associated with reporting increased levels of problematic social media use, B = 1.15, SE B = .32, t(1, 4938) = 3.59, p < .001. The indirect effects in each model from obesity to problematic social media use, through both symptoms of anxiety and depression separately, were significant, B = .14, SE B = .05, confidence interval [0.055, .231] and B = .16, SE B = .07, confidence interval [0.018, .317], respectively. Conclusions: Young adults who present both with obesity and with symptoms of depression or anxiety are more at risk for problematic social media use. These patients may benefit from education on health-promoting social media use.

29939357	Association between long-term exposure to air pollution and sleep disorder in Chinese children: the Seven Northeastern Cities study.	Sleep	2018	test	26	7	9	Association between long-term exposure to air pollution and sleep disorder in Chinese children: the Seven Northeastern Cities study.  Study Objectives: There is limited knowledge regarding the effects of air pollution on sleep disorders, particularly in children. The aim of this study is to investigate this association in Chinese children. Methods: During 2012-2013, 59754 children aged 2-17 years were randomly selected from 27 districts in seven northeastern Chinese cities. All participants' sleep was evaluated with the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Four year average concentrations of pollutants were calculated for particles with an aerodynamic diameter of <=1 microm (PM1), <=2.5 microm (PM2.5) from a spatial statistical model, and <=10 microm (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO) from monitoring stations. To examine the effects, two-level regression analysis was used, controlling for covariates. Results: We observed that sleep disorder was generally associated with all air pollutants, with the highest odds among PM1 exposure for male (odds ratio [OR] 1.55; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.36-1.76) and female (OR 1.50; 95% CI 1.30-1.72) children. The overall strongest association with sleep disorder symptom was exposure to PM1 and Disorders of Excessive Somnolence (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.30-1.58). PM1 and PM2.5 were strongly associated with all sleep disorder symptoms in females (ORs ranged for PM1 from 1.19 to 1.49; and PM2.5 1.18 to 1.44). The association between air pollutants and total sleep score was generally greater in female than in male children. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that exposure to air pollutants increases the odds of sleep disorder in children and point to the need to make reducing exposure to air pollutants a public health priority.  
23271217	The role of fluoride in the preventive management of dentin hypersensitivity and root caries.	Clinical oral investigations	2013	test	16	5	6	The role of fluoride in the preventive management of dentin hypersensitivity and root caries.  OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to bring light on fluoride to control dentin hypersensitivity (DHS) and prevent root caries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Search strategy included papers mainly published in PubMed, Medline from October 2000 to October 2011. RESULTS: Fluoride toothpaste shows a fair effect on sensitive teeth when combined with dentin fluid-obstructing agents such as different metal ions, potassium, and oxalates. Fluoride in solution, gel, and varnish give an instant and long-term relief of dentin and bleaching hypersensitivity. Combined with laser technology, a limited additional positive effect is achieved. Prevention of root caries is favored by toothpaste with 5,000 ppm F and by fluoride rinsing with 0.025-0.1 % F solutions, as the application of fluoride gel or fluoride varnish three to four times a year. Fluoride measures with tablets, chewing gum, toothpick, and flossing may be questioned because of unfavorable cost effectiveness ratio. CONCLUSION: Most fluoride preparations in combination with dentin fluid obstruction agents are beneficial to reduce DHS. Prevention of root caries is favorable with higher fluoride concentrations in, e.g., toothpaste. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Fluoride is an effective agent to control DHS and to prevent root caries particularly when used in higher concentrations.  
27521165	The prevalence and predictors of disordered eating in women with coeliac disease.	Appetite	2016	test	15	17	1	The prevalence and predictors of disordered eating in women with coeliac disease.  PURPOSE: The need for dietary management in coeliac disease may lead to the development of disordered eating. This study examined the prevalence of disordered eating and factors predicting disordered eating in women with coeliac disease, compared with other dietary-controlled conditions. METHODS: A cross-sectional, online survey assessing psychological well-being, disordered eating behaviours (Eating Attitudes Test 26 (EAT-26); Binge Eating Scale (BES)) was distributed using online forums, to those with coeliac disease (N = 157), inflammatory bowel disease (N = 116), type two diabetes (N = 88) and healthy controls (N = 142). Hierarchical regressions were conducted to explore and compare the predictors of EAT-26 and BES scores across all groups. Within the coeliac disease group, a cluster analysis was conducted to examine types of disordered eating. RESULTS: Higher EAT-26 scores were found in those with coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease compared with healthy controls and type two diabetes; participants with a chronic health condition had higher BES than healthy control participants. The factors associated with EAT-26 scores differed across the dietary-controlled health conditions, with dietary management being important for those with coeliac disease. Psychological distress was associated with binge-eating behaviour across all groups. Cluster analyses found two types of disordered eating in coeliac disease; a binge eating type and a restrictive type. CONCLUSIONS: Disordered eating attitudes and behaviours are more prevalent in participants with chronic health conditions relative to healthy controls. The presence of binge eating behaviours in coeliac disease may be related to non-coeliac disease specific factors such as the distress associated with dietary-controlled illness. EAT-26 scores in coeliac disease are associated with disease specific factors, unique to following the gluten-free diet. These factors are important for identifying and supporting those with coeliac disease and disordered eating.  
16476130	The prevalence of eating disorders among university students and the relationship with some individual characteristics.	The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry	2006	test	5	14	1	The prevalence of eating disorders among university students and the relationship with some individual characteristics.  OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of eating disorders (EDs) among university students in a rural area of Turkey and to compare groups based on the sociodemographic data, history of child abuse and neglect, family roles and self-esteem with a normal control group regarding EDs. METHOD: Subjects who were chosen by simple random sampling method were consisted of 980 Cumhuriyet University students who agreed to participate out of the 1003 total students and were given a sociodemographic information form and an Eating Attitudes Test (EAT). Students who scored above a cutoff level on the EAT were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV axis I Disorders (SCID-I), Clinical Version. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Family Assessment Device (FAD) and Childhood Abuse and Neglect Questionnaire Form were given to subjects in the control and study groups. RESULTS: Seventy-one of the 951 students (492 female, 459 male) who correctly filled out the EAT had a score above the cutoff level of 30 or higher. Of these 71 students, 21 (2.20%) were found to have an eating disorder based on the SCID-I. No subjects were found to have anorexia nervosa. Eighteen of the 21 subjects were female. Of these 18 female students, 15 (1.57%) were found to have bulimia nervosa and three (0.31%) were found to have binge eating disorder (BED). All of the three male subjects were diagnosed with BED (0.31%). The self-esteem of those in the study group was lower than those in the control group (p < 0.001). Subjects in the study group had more frequent histories of sexual and emotional abuse in childhood (p < 0.05). Also, in the study group scores showing communication in FAD families, unity and emotional attachment were statistically significantly lower than the control group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: It has been observed from the results of this research that the frequency of bulimia nervosa and BED in this sample is so similar to Western samples. Besides that, self-esteem, child abuse and neglect, and family functions must be examined in detail because they are risk factors for EDs and affect the course of treatment.  
10544609	[Organ pathology causing sudden death in athletes. International study of autopsies (Germany, Austria, Switzerland)].	Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)	1999	test	13	10	0	[Organ pathology causing sudden death in athletes. International study of autopsies (Germany, Austria, Switzerland)].  BACKGROUND: Accordance of all studies concerning the distribution of causes of cardiovascular sports deaths can only be registered in the dominating role of coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction among athletes > 35 years. In North America a predominance of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy among younger sportsmen (< or = 35 years) is described. This study investigates the conditions in the German speaking countries in central Europe. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present prospective and retrospective 1.5-year (July 1996 to December 1997) study is based on post-mortem examinations of 28 institutes of pathology and forensic medicine in Germany, Austria and German speaking Switzerland. RESULTS: Twelve out of 113 cases (10.6%) were females, their age being significantly lower (27.8 years, sd = 15.2) than the age of the males (37.5 years, sd = 16.5). Eighty sports deaths (70.8%) were caused by cardiovascular reasons, 33 sports deaths (29.2%) were traumatic in origin. The main cause of cardiovascular deaths of the older athletes (> 35 years) was the coronary heart disease (84.1%). The main reasons for cardiovascular deaths of younger athletes (< or = 35 years) were the coronary heart disease (36.1%) and myocarditis (30.6%). A case of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was not registered. Most of sports deaths happened in soccer (28), jogging (15), walking (8), cycling (7) and skiing (7). Most of traumatic sports deaths were registered in aerial sports. Four ball players (soccer n = 3, handball n = 1) and 1 motor cyclist suffered from a thrombosis after an orthopedic injury and died due to a consecutive pulmonary embolism. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of cardiovascular sports deaths displays astonishing regional differences. In contrast to North America anatomical-pathological studies of German speaking countries do not show any dominance of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy among younger athletes, although the pathologists in recent investigations knew the results of Maron. Possible explanations for this phenomenon might be varying selections of patients (top-performance athletes and hobby sportsmen) or a different genetical background.  
25620040	Slow wave sleep in the chronically fatigued: Power spectra distribution patterns in chronic fatigue syndrome and primary insomnia.	Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology	2015	test	13	21	0	Slow wave sleep in the chronically fatigued: Power spectra distribution patterns in chronic fatigue syndrome and primary insomnia.  OBJECTIVES: To investigate slow wave sleep (SWS) spectral power proportions in distinct clinical conditions sharing non-restorative sleep and fatigue complaints without excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), namely the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and primary insomnia (PI). Impaired sleep homeostasis has been suspected in both CFS and PI. METHODS: We compared perceived sleep quality, fatigue and sleepiness symptom-intensities, polysomnography (PSG) and SWS spectral power distributions of drug-free CFS and PI patients without comorbid sleep or mental disorders, with a good sleeper control group. RESULTS: Higher fatigue without EDS and impaired perceived sleep quality were confirmed in both patient groups. PSG mainly differed in sleep fragmentation and SWS durations. Spectral analysis revealed a similar decrease in central ultra slow power (0.3-0.79Hz) proportion during SWS for both CFS and PI and an increase in frontal power proportions of faster frequencies during SWS in PI only. The latter was correlated to affective symptoms whereas lower central ultra slow power proportions were related to fatigue severity and sleep quality impairment. CONCLUSIONS: In combination with normal (PI) or even increased SWS durations (CFS), we found consistent evidence for lower proportions of slow oscillations during SWS in PI and CFS. SIGNIFICANCE: Observing normal or increased SWS durations but lower proportions of ultra slow power, our findings suggest a possible quantitative compensation of altered homeostatic regulation.  
31606483	Environmental factors associated with allergy in urban and rural children from the South African Food Allergy (SAFFA) cohort.	The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology	2020	test	48	14	6	Environmental factors associated with allergy in urban and rural children from the South African Food Allergy (SAFFA) cohort.  BACKGROUND: The prevalence of allergic diseases differs in urban and rural populations. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess associations between environmental and dietary factors with allergic diseases in urban and rural South African children. METHODS: Toddlers aged 12 to 36 months were assessed for food allergen and aeroallergen sensitization, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma, and challenge-proved food allergy. Information was collected on family history of allergic diseases, household size, socioeconomic status, delivery mode, antibiotic and probiotic use, exposure to fermented and unpasteurized milk, antihelminth treatment, sunlight exposure, pet and farm animal exposure, cigarette smoke, and household cooking and heating fuels. Antenatal exposures to pets, livestock, and cigarette smoke were assessed. A subsection completed questions on consumption of fruits and vegetables, fast foods, soft drinks/fruit juices, and fried/microwaved meat. RESULTS: Risk and protective factors differed between urban and rural settings. Exposure to farm animals in infants and their mothers during pregnancy was protective against allergic outcomes in the rural population. Consumption of unpasteurized milk is uncommon in this group of rural children and is unlikely to be an important factor in rural protection. In urban children birth by cesarean section is associated with food allergy, and consumption of fermented milk products is associated with reduced asthma and atopic dermatitis. In both cohorts antenatal maternal smoking and environmental smoking exposure were predominantly associated with asthma, and consumption of fast foods and fried meats were associated with allergy. CONCLUSION: In this rural environment exposure to livestock is the strongest protective factor. In urban communities, where animal contact is rare, risk factors include cesarian section, and protective factors include consumption of fermented milk products. Modifiable risk factors urgently require interventions to prevent increasing allergy rates in countries undergoing rapid urbanization.  
24005946	A view from behind: a history of lingual orthodontics.	Journal of orthodontics	2013	test	3	0	0	A view from behind: a history of lingual orthodontics.  Lingual orthodontic appliances have experienced a renaissance in the UK over the past 5 years, becoming more widely accepted as a suitable alternative to conventional labial appliances when treating most malocclusions. Clinically improved laboratory techniques have overcome many of the difficulties that a previous generation of orthodontists encountered when first trying to embrace this innovative technique to correct malocclusions. This article provides a brief history of lingual orthodontics. It will discuss the development of the technique, the reasons for its initial rise and fall in popularity, and more recent developments that have re-established its popularity among orthodontists in the UK.  
25354495	Socioeconomic and lifestyle factors and melanoma: a systematic review.	The British journal of dermatology	2015	test	25	8	24	Socioeconomic and lifestyle factors and melanoma: a systematic review.  Evidence of social determinants of disease and awareness of the impact of these factors on outcomes continues to increase. Social determinants include both socioeconomic and lifestyle factors. This review examines the interface between socioeconomic status (SES) and lifestyle and their effects on melanoma incidence and mortality. Lifestyle factors including occupation, occupational exposures, body mass index, marital status, smoking, recreational sun exposure and tanning were explored as they have a known relationship with melanoma. A remarkable association of SES with melanoma incidence and prognosis has been acknowledged worldwide. Melanoma incidence is increased in populations of higher SES, especially among the highly educated, while lower SES populations present with later-stage disease at time of diagnosis and display greater mortality. The aforementioned lifestyle factors are also related to SES, and have been shown internationally to affect melanoma incidence and mortality. This comprehensive systematic review suggests that lifestyle factors including occupation, occupational exposure, obesity, recreational sun exposure and tanning may explain the relationship between SES and melanoma.  
27141895	[Prevalence and risk factors of hypertension among residents of 30 years or above years old in Pengzhou city of Sichuan province].	Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine]	2016	test	14	9	13	[Prevalence and risk factors of hypertension among residents of 30 years or above years old in Pengzhou city of Sichuan province].  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of hypertension among residents in Pengzhou city of Sichuan province. METHODS: Among 20 townships in Pengzhou city of Sichuan Province, 14 townships were selected using a clustered sampling based on the economic level and distance. The registered residents in the selected townships aged 30-79 years were recruited for a comprehensive survey from 2004 to 2007. A total of 55 687 residents (21 315 males and 34 372 females) were selected based on a face to face questionnaire interview and physical examination; the patient group included 14 151 residents with hypertension and the control group had 41 536 residents without hypertension were selected. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to investigate the influence factors for hypertension. OR (95%CI) values were calculated. Different levels of risk exposure factors were transformed into the risk scores using a statistical model. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of hypertension was 25.41% among residents aged 30 years or above in Pengzhou (14 151/55 687), 28.95% (6 170/21 315) for male residents and 23.22% (7 981/34 372) for female residents. Multivaraite logistic regression analysis showed that main risk factors for hypertension in male residents were age, low educational level, widower, low household income, no medical insurance, no fresh fruits intake, high body mass index (BMI), high waist to hip ratio, and low physical activity, which was less than 3 metabolic equivalent of task (MET) level, among which the highest three riskswere (not including the social demographic characteristics) BMI>=28 kg/m(2), waist to hip ratio >=0.90, and not consuming fresh fruits. OR (95% CI) values for these three key factors were 3.74 (3.27-4.28), 1.34 (1.24-1.44), and 1.27 (1.14-1.41), respectively. The corresponding risk scores for these factors were 2.993, 1.102, and 1.237, respectively. Main risk factors for hypertension in female residents were age, working hours, no medical insurance, fewer number of family members, no fresh fruits intake, smoking, never drinking tea, no dairy products intake, high BMI, highwaist to hip ratio and low physical activity, among which the highest three risks were (not including the social demographic characteristics) BMI >=28 kg/m(2), MET level, and waist to hip ratio >=0.85. OR (95% CI) values for these three key factors were 3.30 (3.02-3.60), 1.35 (1.22-1.51), and 1.33 (1.23-1.44), respectively. The corresponding risk scores for these factors were 2.390, 1.263, and 1.051, respectively. CONCLUSION: The prevalence rate of hypertension among the residents over 30 years of age in Pengzhou city was 25.41%. The main risk factors were age, not consuming fresh fruits, high BMI, high waist to hip ratio, and low MET level.  
22645325	Nested case-control study of night shift work and breast cancer risk among women in the Danish military.	Occupational and environmental medicine	2012	test	17	7	7	Nested case-control study of night shift work and breast cancer risk among women in the Danish military.  OBJECTIVES: Growing but limited evidence suggests that night shift work is associated with breast cancer. The authors conducted a nationwide case-control study nested within a cohort of 18,551 female military employees born in 1929-1968 to investigate the risk for breast cancer after night shift work and to explore the role of leisure time sun exposure and diurnal preference. METHODS: The authors documented 218 cases of breast cancer (1990-2003) and selected 899 age-matched controls from the cohort by incidence density sampling. Information on shift work, sun exposure habits, diurnal preference and other potential confounders was obtained from a structured questionnaire. ORs were estimated by multivariate conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, the authors observed an adjusted OR of 1.4 (95% CI 0.9 to 2.1) among women with ever compared with never night shifts. The RR for breast cancer tended to increase with increasing number of years of night shift work (p=0.03) and with cumulative number of shifts (p=0.02),with a neutral risk for fewer than three night shifts per week. The OR for the group with the highest tertile of cumulative exposure was 2.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 4.6). The most pronounced effect of night shift work on breast cancer risk was observed in women with morning chronotype preference and intense night shifts (OR=3.9, 95% CI 1.6 to 9.5). Night shift workers tended to sunbathe more frequently than day workers. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that frequent night shift work increases the risk for breast cancer and suggest a higher risk with longer duration of intense night shifts. Women with morning preference who worked on night shifts tended to have a higher risk than those with evening preference.  
26093582	Current knowledge, attitude and behaviour of hand and food hygiene in a developed residential community of Singapore: a cross-sectional survey.	BMC public health	2015	test	17	6	6	Current knowledge, attitude and behaviour of hand and food hygiene in a developed residential community of Singapore: a cross-sectional survey.  BACKGROUND: Diarrhoea incidence has been increasing progressively over the past years in developed countries, including Singapore, despite the accessibility and availability to clean water, well-established sanitation infrastructures and regular hygiene promotion. The aim of this study is to determine the current knowledge, attitude and behaviour of hand and food hygiene, and the potential risk factors of diarrhoea in a residential community of Singapore. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted within a residential area in the west of Singapore from June to August 2013. A total of 1,156 household units were randomly sampled and invited to participate in an interviewer-assisted survey using standardised questionnaires. Descriptive, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using descriptive statistics, Fisher's Exact test and multivariate logistic regression modelling, respectively. R program was used for all statistical analysis. All tests were conducted at 5% level of significance with 95% confidence intervals (CI) reported where applicable. RESULTS: A total of 240 units (20.8%) consented and responded to the survey invitation. About 77% of the expected knowledge and attitude were observed in at least 80% of the participants, compared to only about 31% of the expected behaviours and practises. Being single [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.16-4.48], having flu in the past six month (AOR = 3.24; 95% CI = 1.74-6.06), preferred self-medication (AOR = 2.07; 95% CI = 1.06-4.12) were risk factors of diarrhoea. Washing hands with water before attending to children or sick persons (AOR = 0.30; 95% CI = 0.11-0.82), washing hands with water (AOR = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.05-0.45) and water with soap (AOR = 0.29; 95% CI = 0.12-0.72) after attending to children or sick persons, and hand washing between 30 s to a minute (AOR = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.20-0.90) were protective factors against diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS: Good knowledge and attitude of the participants did not positively translate into high compliance and motivation to perform good hygiene practices. This observation may have resulted in a significant extent on the increasing diarrhoea incidences. Current interventions may be improved with more active community partnership among the residents, schools and the relevant social organizations, to raise awareness on the importance of compliance to good hygiene practices, and the risk factors of diarrhoea. A large case-control study would be required to validate these findings in future.  
20472573	FCTC guidelines on tobacco industry foreign investment would strengthen controls on tobacco supply and close loopholes in the tobacco treaty.	Tobacco control	2010	test	1	0	0	FCTC guidelines on tobacco industry foreign investment would strengthen controls on tobacco supply and close loopholes in the tobacco treaty.  The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) contains no provisions covering tobacco industry investments. This creates the potential for tobacco companies to benefit from investment liberalisation by using foreign investments to avoid tobacco tariffs, increase tobacco consumption and otherwise impair the implementation of FCTC-style measures. Reducing and ultimately eliminating foreign investment activities by tobacco companies can be justified on health grounds, even though it runs counter to current investment liberalisation trends. Through the FCTC process, non-binding guidelines can be elaborated to assist parties in recognising and responding to foreign investment strategies of tobacco companies, to support efforts to exclude the tobacco sector from investment liberalisation and otherwise would improve all countries' awareness of the threat from foreign investment strategies of tobacco companies and provide them with approaches to handle the problems.

This survey was carried out to allow a minimum data set required for intra- and extra-oral photographs to be established. In 1999 a questionnaire was sent to members of the Angle Society of Europe to establish their current clinical practice with regard to extra- and intra-oral photography. The Angle Society was chosen because of their stated commitment to a high standard of record keeping and of clinical care. Results showed that a full series of extra- and intra-oral photographs were taken both before and after treatment, as well as stage photographs during treatment on many cases. The need for each of these photographs will be discussed in some detail, and recommendations will be made as to what would be considered the Gold standard before, during, and after a course of orthodontic treatment.  
11218778	[Cancer and prevention].	Ugeskrift for laeger	2001	test	8	18	26	[Cancer and prevention].  INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to estimate the preventable potential of various types of cancer in Denmark on the basis of present knowledge. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The well-documented factors in lifestyle and environment causing cancer in Denmark were identified from the IARC Monograph series. The population attributable risk per cent (PAR%) and the annual number of preventable cancers were calculated for each aetiology and cancer type around the year 2000. RESULTS: A large proportion of the cancers occurring in the lungs, larynx, upper digestive tract, skin, lower urinary tract, and the uterine cervix is potentially avoidable, whereas only a small proportion of breast and colorectal cancers is preventable on the given knowledge. The main causative factors include active and passive smoking, alcohol intake, exposure to asbestos and other occupational carcinogens, solar and ionising radiation, obesity, human papillomavirus infection in the female genital tract, and infection with Helicobacter pylori. More than 5000 cancers in men and almost 3500 in women annually in Denmark could have been avoided by eliminating exposure to these known carcinogens. This is equivalent to 39% and 23% of all cancers occurring respectively in men and women, around the year 2000. Smoking habits account for more than half of these avoidable cases. DISCUSSION: The incidence of cancer could be greatly reduced through primary prevention, especially of tobacco smoking, which is the major single factor. A large proportion of the cancers occurring in the lungs, larynx, upper digestive tract, skin, lower urinary tract, and the uterine cervix are potentially avoidable. More research in the field of aetiological factors causing female breast cancer and colorectal cancer is much needed in order to be able to prevent these types of cancer.  
29680886	Phthalates and type 1 diabetes: is there any link?	Environmental science and pollution research international	2018	test	5	11	1	Phthalates and type 1 diabetes: is there any link?  Phthalates are a group of chemical compounds used as plasticizers in the manufacture of plastic materials. They can be present in many commonly used products. There seems to be a relationship between exposure to phthalates and the occurrence of metabolic dysfunctions, such as a decrease in glucose tolerance, oxidative stress, loss of beta cells, and a decrease in insulin synthesis. As beta cells play a key role in the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), we sought to investigate the relationship between exposure to phthalates and the diagnosis of T1DM in prepubertal children. Design concentrations of phthalate metabolites were compared in the urine of a population of prepubertal children with new-onset diabetes, patients with T1DM diagnosed more than 6 months previously, and healthy control children. Although the concentrations of DBP and DiBP metabolites were statistically identical in the new-onset diabetes, diabetes, and control groups, there was a clear trend for higher levels of DiBP metabolites in the children with new-onset diabetes. In our sample, there was a trend for higher levels of DiBP metabolites in children with new-onset diabetes.

BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers are sharing their challenges, including sleep disturbances, on social media; however, no study has evaluated sleep in predominantly US frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess sleep among a sample of predominantly US frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic using validated measures through a survey distributed on social media. METHODS: A self-selection survey was distributed on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for 16 days (August 31 to September 15, 2020), targeting health care workers who were clinically active during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and they reported their demographic and career information. Poor sleep quality was defined as a PSQI score >=5. Moderate-to-severe insomnia was defined as an ISI score >14. The Mini-Z Burnout Survey was used to measure burnout. Multivariate logistic regression tested associations between demographics, career characteristics, and sleep outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 963 surveys were completed. Participants were predominantly White (894/963, 92.8%), female (707/963, 73.4%), aged 30-49 years (692/963, 71.9%), and physicians (620/963, 64.4%). Mean sleep duration was 6.1 hours (SD 1.2). Nearly 96% (920/963, 95.5%) of participants reported poor sleep (PSQI). One-third (288/963, 30%) reported moderate or severe insomnia. Many participants (554/910, 60.9%) experienced sleep disruptions due to device use or had nightmares at least once per week (420/929, 45.2%). Over 50% (525/932, 56.3%) reported burnout. In multivariable logistic regressions, nonphysician (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, 95% CI 1.7-3.4), caring for patients with COVID-19 (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.8), Hispanic ethnicity (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.5), female sex (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4), and having a sleep disorder (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.7-6.9) were associated with increased odds of insomnia. In open-ended comments (n=310), poor sleep was mapped to four categories: children and family, work demands, personal health, and pandemic-related sleep disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all the frontline health care workers surveyed on social media reported poor sleep, over one-third reported insomnia, and over half reported burnout. Many also reported sleep disruptions due to device use and nightmares. Sleep interventions for frontline health care workers are urgently needed.  
25662056	Multiple cardiometabolic risk factors in the Southern Cone of Latin America: a population-based study in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay.	International journal of cardiology	2015	test	8	25	4	Multiple cardiometabolic risk factors in the Southern Cone of Latin America: a population-based study in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay.  BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death, and its mortality is increasing in Latin America. However, population-based data on cardiovascular disease risk factors are sparse in these countries. METHODS: A total of 7524 men and women, aged 35 to 74 years old, were recruited between February 2010 and December 2011 from randomly selected samples in 4 cities (Bariloche and Marcos Paz, Argentina; Temuco, Chile; and Pando-Barros Blancos, Uruguay) in the Southern Cone of Latin America. Cardiovascular risk factors were measured using standard methods by trained and certified observers. RESULTS: Approximately 85.5% of adults ate less than five servings of fruit or vegetables per day, 35.2% engaged in low physical activity, and 29.7% currently smoked cigarettes. The prevalences of obesity, central obesity, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome were 35.7%, 52.9%, 40.8%, 2.0%, 58.4%, 12.4%, and 37.4%, respectively. The proportion of individuals with >=3 cardiovascular risk factors, including low intake of fruit and vegetables, low physical activity, current cigarette smoking, obesity or central obesity, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, was 68.3%, and the proportion of individuals with >=3 cardiometabolic risk factors, including obesity or central obesity, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, was 22.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular disease risk factors are highly prevalent in the general population in the Southern Cone of Latin America. These data suggest that national efforts on the prevention, treatment, and control of cardiovascular risk factors should be a public health priority in the Southern Cone of Latin America.  
33245701	Immune Competence and Minimizing Susceptibility to COVID-19 and Other Immune System Threats.	Alternative therapies in health and medicine	2020	test	20	7	7	Immune Competence and Minimizing Susceptibility to COVID-19 and Other Immune System Threats.  Exposure to viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens is unavoidable. Yet, the mere presence of these threats is not enough to automatically predispose to illness. The susceptibility of an individual to viral or bacterial infections is dependent upon immune competence. Many factors can interfere with the functioning of the immune system. Epigenetic alterations in the form of lifestyle or environmental factors can lead to impaired immunity. For example, exposure to air pollution can increase the risk of complications and mortality from COVID-19. Obesity can also exacerbate the damaging effects of air pollution on the lungs and may enhance the association between air pollution and increased COVID-19 severity. Poor sleep is another factor leading to impaired immunity, likely due to the coinciding melatonin depletion. Melatonin has been found to have antiviral and immune-enhancing effects, and it has been proposed that this hormone may be beneficial in COVID-19 patients. Zinc and vitamins D and C have also been well studied for their ability to shorten the duration of upper respiratory infections, and vitamin D has been found to reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients. Cannabidiol can both directly and indirectly improve immunity by enhancing natural killer cell activity, reducing inflammation, and relieving stress. Other dietary supplements backed by solid scientific evidence to show they act as immune enhancers are astragalus, a yeast fermentate (EpiCor(R)), olive leaf extract, berberine, N-acetyl cysteine, and garlic.  
30021753	Causes of premature death and their associated risk factors in the Golestan Cohort Study, Iran.	BMJ open	2018	test	15	11	0	Causes of premature death and their associated risk factors in the Golestan Cohort Study, Iran.  OBJECTIVES: To examine the causes of premature mortality (<70 years) and associated risk factors in the Golestan Cohort Study. DESIGN: Prospective. SETTING: The Golestan Cohort Study in northeastern Iran. PARTICIPANTS: 50 045 people aged 40 or more participated in this population-based study from baseline (2004-2008) to August 2017, with over 99% success follow-up rate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The top causes of premature death, HR and their 95% CI and population attributable fraction (PAF) for risk factors. RESULTS: After 444 168 person-years of follow-up (median of 10 years), 6347 deaths were reported, of which 4018 (63.3%) occurred prematurely. Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) accounted for 33.9% of premature death, followed by stroke (14.0%), road injuries (4.7%), stomach cancer (4.6%) and oesophageal cancer (4.6%). Significant risk/protective factors were: wealth score (HR for highest vs lowest quintile: 0.57, PAF for lowest four quintiles vs top quintile: 28%), physical activity (highest vs lowest tertile: 0.67, lowest two tertiles vs top tertile: 22%), hypertension (1.50, 19%), opium use (1.69, 14%), education (middle school or higher vs illiterate: 0.84, illiterate or primary vs middle school or higher: 13%), tobacco use (1.38, 11%), diabetes (2.39, 8%) and vegetable/fruit consumption (highest vs lowest tertile: 0.87, lowest two tertiles vs top tertile: 8%). Collectively, these factors accounted for 76% of PAF in men and 69% in women. CONCLUSION: IHD and stroke are the leading causes of premature mortality in the Golestan Cohort Study. Enhancing socioeconomic status and physical activity, reducing opium and tobacco use, increasing vegetable/fruit consumption and controlling hypertension and diabetes are recommended to reduce premature deaths.  
15358938	Dissociation and variability of adult attachment dimensions and early maladaptive schemas in sexual and violent offenders.	Journal of interpersonal violence	2004	test	0	0	0	Dissociation and variability of adult attachment dimensions and early maladaptive schemas in sexual and violent offenders.  The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of constructs that may indicate the presence of disorganized attachment style in sexual and violent offenders. Constructs measured were dissociation, variability on self-report measures of attachment style and early maladaptive schemas, and variability in observed behavior. Data on variability was collected at four time intervals, approximately 3 weeks apart. No differences between the groups were found in variability of self-reported attachment style. Both offending groups showed greater variability in early schemas and higher levels of dissociation than the nonoffending group. Sex offenders showed greater variability than violent offenders in behaviors related to distress.  
34541377	Dog ownership, demographics, owners' knowledge of rabies, and factors associated with canine rabies vaccination in urban and rural areas of Dedougou, Burkina Faso.	Veterinary and animal science	2021	test	12	7	0	Dog ownership, demographics, owners' knowledge of rabies, and factors associated with canine rabies vaccination in urban and rural areas of Dedougou, Burkina Faso.  Rabies is a prioritized zoonotic disease in Burkina Faso and is known as a major zoonotic disease with high public health importance. This investigation was conducted to assess community knowledge, dog ecology and demographics, and factors associated with dog vaccination against rabies in the urban and rural areas of Dedougou. Three hundred and sixteen (316) dog-owning households were surveyed in the rural and urban areas of Dedougou using a semi-structured questionnaire. Among participants, 55.7% lived in rural area, and 59.8% were farmers. Only 34.5% of participants had satisfactory knowledge of rabies. About 22% were aware of the required age of dogs' primo vaccination against rabies while 55.7% knew the frequency of booster vaccination. Participants living in households with less than five persons were significantly more likely to be aware of rabies than those living in households with the higher number of persons (P<0.05). Participants who were aware of rabies were more likely to vaccinate their dogs compared to those who were not aware of rabies (P<0.05). In total, 2930 persons were recorded in visited households with 60.6% from rural area, and an average household size of 9.27 persons. Three hundred and thirty seven dogs were found in surveyed households' and 54.9% were from rural area. In overall, a dog per human ratio of 1:8.7 was determinated. Regarding dog ownership practices, the majority of respondents reported that they provided their dogs with water (84.5%) and food (84.8%). This research reported supplementary data on dog ecology and rabies, which could be useful for rabies control planning in Burkina Faso.  
30354015	Specific Sports Habits, Leisure-Time Physical Activity, and School-Educational Physical Activity in Children With Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: Patterns and Barriers.	Arthritis care & research	2019	test	21	7	5	Specific Sports Habits, Leisure-Time Physical Activity, and School-Educational Physical Activity in Children With Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: Patterns and Barriers.  OBJECTIVE: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) may cause functional impairment and reduced time engaged in physical activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the habits of patients with JIA regarding participation in club sports, leisure-time physical activity, and school-educational physical activity and relate this to objectively measured physical activity using accelerometry and to compare the findings with those in healthy controls. METHODS: Consecutive patients from the Aarhus University Hospital outpatient clinic were included. Clinical characteristics, functional ability, and exploration of specific habits in club sports, leisure-time physical activity, and school-educational physical activity (based on a standardized questionnaire) in patients were recorded and compared with those in healthy controls. The intensity and frequency of physical activity were measured by accelerometer monitoring, using ActiGraph GT1M. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients with JIA and 118 healthy control subjects were included. Despite having low disease activity, children with JIA had significantly lower accelerometry-monitored physical activity levels compared with healthy controls. The distribution of specific club sport activities was the same among patients and controls. However, the proportion of patients spending >3 hours/week participating in club sports was significantly lower than the proportion of controls, whereas no difference in time spent engaging in physical activity during leisure-time was observed. Participation in compulsory school-educational physical activity was equally high in patients and controls, although participation by patients was significantly less consistent than that by controls. Patient reports of time spent with club sport and leisure-time physical activity was significantly related to accelerometry measures, whereas this was not observed for school-educational physical activity. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate the need for structured guidance for all patients with JIA (including those with minimal disease activity) in both understanding and coping with the consequences of a low level of physical activity.  
20645220	JAKOB narrative analysis: the psychodynamic conflict as a narrative model.	Psychotherapy research : journal of the Society for Psychotherapy Research	2010	test	1	1	0	JAKOB narrative analysis: the psychodynamic conflict as a narrative model.  When a patient tells a story during psychotherapy sessions, it is both a mutual interaction between patient and therapist and a presentation of personal experience. The patient calls up and re-creates a biographical occurrence and puts it before a listener for viewing, enacting it verbally in the perspective of wish fulfillment and anxiety coping. JAKOB narrative analysis, situated in the field of psychoanalytical and narrative analytical research, is an encoding-supported qualitative instrument for the systematic reconstruction of verbal everyday narratives in the context of psychotherapeutic processes. In this study, the JAKOB narrative analysis is described in detail with the aid of an example narrative, put in relation to the therapeutic process, and discussed critically from a methodological viewpoint.  
21410952	Inflammatory Signals shift from adipose to liver during high fat feeding and influence the development of steatohepatitis in mice.	Journal of inflammation (London, England)	2011	test	9	15	5	Inflammatory Signals shift from adipose to liver during high fat feeding and influence the development of steatohepatitis in mice.  BACKGROUND: Obesity and inflammation are highly integrated processes in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Molecular mechanisms underlying inflammatory events during high fat diet-induced obesity are poorly defined in mouse models of obesity. This work investigated gene activation signals integral to the temporal development of obesity. METHODS: Gene expression analysis in multiple organs from obese mice was done with Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA) using a panel of 92 genes representing cell markers, cytokines, chemokines, metabolic, and activation genes. Mice were monitored for systemic changes characteristic of the disease, including hyperinsulinemia, body weight, and liver enzymes. Liver steatosis and fibrosis as well as cellular infiltrates in liver and adipose tissues were analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Obese C57BL/6 mice were fed with high fat and cholesterol diet (HFC) for 6, 16 and 26 weeks. Here we report that the mRNA levels of macrophage and inflammation associated genes were strongly upregulated at different time points in adipose tissues (6-16 weeks) and liver (16-26 weeks), after the start of HFC feeding. CD11b+ and CD11c+ macrophages highly infiltrated HFC liver at 16 and 26 weeks. We found clear evidence that signals for IL-1beta, IL1RN, TNF-alpha and TGFbeta-1 are present in both adipose and liver tissues and that these are linked to the development of inflammation and insulin resistance in the HFC-fed mice. CONCLUSIONS: Macrophage infiltration accompanied by severe inflammation and metabolic changes occurred in both adipose and liver tissues with a temporal shift in these signals depending upon the duration of HFC feeding. The evidences of gene expression profile, elevated serum alanine aminotransferase, and histological data support a progression towards nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis in these HFC-fed mice within the time frame of 26 weeks.  
18209234	Daily walking in older adults: day-to-day variability and criterion-referenced validity of total daily step counts.	Journal of physical activity & health	2007	test	8	0	0	Daily walking in older adults: day-to-day variability and criterion-referenced validity of total daily step counts.  OBJECTIVE: To determine the day-to-day variability of older adults' physical activity, and to evaluate the accuracy of the 10,000-step goal for classifying whether older adults obtain 30 minutes of MVPA. METHODS: Ninety-one adults of age over 60 years of age wore a Yamax pedometer and Actigraph accelerometer for 7 days. Interday reliability was estimated via two-way ANOVA ICCs, and classification accuracy was evaluated via sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curve analysis. RESULTS: Interday reliability was high; 4 of 5 outcome measures had a reliability of > or = .80 with only 2 days of data. The 10,000-step cut point had high accuracy for identifying days with less than 30 minutes of MVPA, but poor accuracy for identifying days with more than 30 minutes of MVPA. CONCLUSIONS: Day-to-day variability in physical activity is lower in older adults than other age groups. The 10,000-step goal is inadequate for determining whether daily physical activity includes 30 minutes of MVPA in this population.  
33555216	Dislocated intrauterine devices: clinical presentations, diagnosis and management.	The European journal of contraception & reproductive health care : the official journal of the European Society of Contraception	2021	test	12	2	2	Dislocated intrauterine devices: clinical presentations, diagnosis and management.  OBJECTIVE: Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are globally one of the most popular methods of contraception. Uterine perforation is one of the most significant complications of IUD use and commonly occurs at the time of IUD insertion rather than presenting as delayed migration. This paper reports a series of 13 cases of displaced IUDs requiring retrieval by laparoscopy or laparotomy. All the IUDs were copper bearing and most perforations occurred immediately after IUD insertion. CASES: In two patients with sigmoid colon injury and IUD penetration of the appendix, laparoscopic management had failed and laparotomy was necessary owing to severe obliteration of the pelvic cavity. In one patient laparotomy was the preferred surgical approach owing to acute bowel perforation. In the remaining patients, the displaced devices were successfully removed by laparoscopy. CONCLUSION: Uterine perforation and IUD migration to the organs in the abdominopelvic cavity are serious complications of IUD insertion and can be successfully managed by laparoscopy, or by laparotomy in the presence of severe pelvic adhesions or unexpected complications.  
31345427	Does Socioeconomic Status Influence the Risk of Subclinical Atherosclerosis?: A Mediation Model.	Journal of the American College of Cardiology	2019	test	30	12	20	Does Socioeconomic Status Influence the Risk of Subclinical Atherosclerosis?: A Mediation Model.  BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic status (SES)-education, income level, and occupation-is associated with cardiovascular risk. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the association between SES and subclinical atherosclerosis and the potential mechanisms involved. METHODS: SES, lifestyle habits (smoking, dietary patterns, physical activity, and hours of sleep), traditional risk factors, and subclinical atherosclerosis extent were prospectively assessed in 4,025 individuals aged 40 to 54 years without known cardiovascular disease enrolled in the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study. After factors associated with atherosclerosis were identified, a multiple mediation model was created to quantify the effect of SES on subclinical atherosclerosis as explained by lifestyle behaviors. RESULTS: Although education level was significantly associated with the presence of atherosclerosis, no differences were found according to income level in this population. Participants with lower education presented with a higher risk of generalized atherosclerosis than those with higher education (odds ratio: 1.46; 95% confidence interval: 1.15 to 1.85; p = 0.002). Lifestyle behaviors associated with both education level and atherosclerosis extent were: smoking status, number of cigarettes/day, and dietary pattern, which explained 70.5% of the effect of SES on atherosclerosis. Of these, tobacco habit (smoking status 35% and number of cigarettes/day 32%) accounted for most of the explained differences between groups, whereas dietary pattern did not remain a significant mediator in the multiple mediation model. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relative economic homogeneity of the cohort, lower education level is associated with increased subclinical atherosclerosis, mainly mediated by the higher and more frequent tobacco consumption. Smoking cessation programs are still needed, particularly in populations with lower education level.  
27146857	Sleep physiology predicts memory retention after reactivation.	Journal of sleep research	2016	test	5	0	0	Sleep physiology predicts memory retention after reactivation.  Both sleep and future relevance influence memory consolidation; however, limited research has investigated their role in memory reconsolidation. We manipulated the future relevance of both stable and labile memories in need of reconsolidation. Two groups learned two blocks of syllable pairs on one evening and were told they would be tested on one of the blocks later. On the second evening, one group (Labile) received reminders designed to return their memories of syllable pairs to a labile state, while a second group (Stable) received reminders designed to leave these memories in a stable state. No significant differences in memory retention were found between blocks or groups the following morning. Frontal delta (0.5-4 Hz) electroencephalographic power during Stage 2 sleep correlated positively with retention of future-relevant material exclusively in the Labile group. Central theta (4-8 Hz) electroencephalographic power during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep correlated positively with the extent to which the Labile group selectively retained future-relevant material. These relationships suggest that sleep-dependent processes are involved in an economical reprocessing of memories beyond the initial stages of consolidation.  
15143792	Spray charging of droplets in a wet scrubber.	Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (1995)	2002	test	2	0	0	Spray charging of droplets in a wet scrubber.  The experimental setup was designed to study the effect of natural charging of droplets during spraying (called spray electrification or spray charging) in a wet scrubber. The influence of nozzle material, liquid feed rate, and liquid composition on the specific charge (charge per unit volume of liquid) formed in spraying was measured. It was found that the nozzle material has no measurable effect on this specific charge. Increasing the liquid feed rate increases the specific charge significantly. Increasing solute (NaCl or NaOH) concentration increases the conductivity that decreases the formed specific charge. The same correlation between the specific charge and conductivity was also observed with real scrubbing liquids. It is proposed that the specific charge depends only on the value of liquid conductivity, not on liquid composition. The conductivity of the tested scrubbing liquids was high enough to suppress the formation of a high specific charge during spraying.  
29294815	Polyvictimization and Psychological Distress in Early Adolescence: A Mediation Model of Defense Mechanisms and Coping Styles.	Journal of interpersonal violence	2020	test	8	2	0	Polyvictimization and Psychological Distress in Early Adolescence: A Mediation Model of Defense Mechanisms and Coping Styles.  In the current study, we aim to examine the link between exposure to multiple traumatic events (polyvictimization), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (PTSS), and psychiatric symptomatology in early adolescence. Furthermore, we aim to explore the mediating roles of defense styles and coping styles in the associations between polyvictimization, PTSS, and psychiatric symptomatology. Data from a Danish national representative sample of 390 eighth-grade students with a mean age of 13.95 (SD = 0.37) years were used. Participants responded to validated self-report questionnaires in 2001. The dimensions of immature defense styles and emotional and avoidance coping mediated the positive associations between polyvictimization, PTSS, and psychiatric symptomatology. Serial multiple mediation indicated that the sum of exposure to traumatic events was significantly associated with more immature defense styles, associated with both high levels emotional and avoidance coping, which, in turn, were associated with high levels of PTSS and psychiatric symptomatology. Polyvictimization is related to adverse outcomes in early adolescence. Both immature defense styles and emotional and avoidance coping styles should be considered as risk factors for the development of psychological distress following exposure to multiple traumas.  
21719896	Menthol preference among smokers: association with TRPA1 variants.	Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco	2011	test	11	1	0	Menthol preference among smokers: association with TRPA1 variants.  INTRODUCTION: Preference for smoking menthol cigarettes differs from individual to individual and population to population in ways that may provide higher levels of nicotine intake and contribute to smoking's morbidity and mortality. Menthol acts at sites that include the transient receptor potential (TRP) A1 channel that is expressed by nociceptors in the lung and airways, suggesting that individual and population differences in TRPA1 sequences might contribute to observed differences in menthol preference among smokers. METHODS: We have thus sought association between menthol preference and common variants in the TRPA1 gene in heavier and lighter European-American smokers. Smokers were recruited for studies of smoking cessation in North Carolina and of substance abuse genetics in Maryland. RESULTS: A common TRPA1 haplotype is defined by 1 missense and 10 intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms that display significant (.006 < p < .05; chi(2)) association with preference for mentholated cigarettes in heavy smokers (odds ratio ca. 1.3). There are smaller trends in the same direction in lighter smokers. CONCLUSIONS: This TRPA1 haplotype provides a novel biological basis for individual differences in menthol preference and possibly for actions of other agents that act at TRPA1.  
18186181	Strengthening the status of psychotherapy for personality disorders: an integrated perspective on effects and costs.	Canadian journal of psychiatry. Revue canadienne de psychiatrie	2007	test	7	10	6	Strengthening the status of psychotherapy for personality disorders: an integrated perspective on effects and costs.  OBJECTIVE: Despite scientific evidence of effectiveness, psychotherapy for personality disorders is not yet fully deployed, nor is its reimbursement self-evident. Both clinicians and health care policy-makers increasingly rely on evidence-based medicine and health economics when determining a treatment of choice and reimbursement. This article aims to contribute to that understanding by applying these criteria on psychotherapy as a treatment for patients with personality disorder. METHOD: We have evaluated the available empirical evidence on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, and integrated this with necessity of treatment as a moderating factor. RESULTS: The effectiveness of psychotherapy for personality disorders is well documented with favourable randomized trial results, 2 metaanalyses, and a Cochrane review. However, the evidence does not yet fully live up to modern standards of evidence-based medicine and is mostly limited to borderline and avoidant personality disorders. Data on cost-effectiveness suggest that psychotherapy for personality disorders may lead to cost-savings. However, state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness data are still scarce. An encouraging factor is that the available studies indicate that patients with personality disorder experience a high burden of disease, stressing the necessity of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: When applying an integrated vision on outcome, psychotherapy can be considered not only an effective treatment for patients with personality disorder but also most likely a cost-effective and necessary intervention. However, more state-of-the-art research is required before clinicians and health care policy-makers can fully appreciate the benefits of psychotherapy for personality disorders. Considerable progress is possible if researchers focus their efforts on evidence-based medicine and cost-effectiveness research.  
11929358	Dermatologic disorders of the athlete.	Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)	2002	test	16	18	6	Dermatologic disorders of the athlete.  The most common injuries afflicting the athlete affect the skin. The list of sports-related dermatoses is vast and includes infections, inflammatory conditions, traumatic entities, environmental encounters, and neoplasms. It is critical that the sports physician recognises common and uncommon skin disorders of the athlete. Knowledge of the treatment and prevention of various sports-related dermatoses results in prompt and appropriate care of the athlete. Infections probably cause the most disruption to individual and team activities. Herpes gladiatorum, tinea corporis gladiatorum, impetigo, and furunculosis are sometimes found in epidemic proportions in athletes. Vigilant surveillance and early treatment help teams avoid these epidemics. Fortunately, several recent studies suggest that pharmacotherapeutic prevention may be effective for some of these sports-related infections. Inflammatory cutaneous conditions may be banal or potentially life threatening as in the case of exercise-induced anaphylaxis. Athletes who develop exercise-induced anaphylaxis may prevent outbreaks by avoiding food before exercise and extreme temperatures while they exercise. Almost all sports enthusiasts are at risk of developing traumatic entities such as nail dystrophies, calluses and blisters. Other more unusual traumatic skin conditions, such as talon noire, jogger's nipples and mogul's palm, occur in specific sports. Several techniques and special clothing exist to help prevent traumatic skin conditions in athletes. Almost all athletes, to some degree, interact with the environment. Winter sport athletes may develop frostbite and swimmers in both fresh and saltwater may develop swimmer's itch or seabather's eruption, respectively. Swimmers with fair skin and light hair may also present with unusual green hair that results from the deposition of copper within the hair. Finally, athletes are at risk of developing both benign and malignant neoplasms. Hockey players, surfers, boxers and football players can develop athlete's nodules. Outdoor sports enthusiasts are at greater risk of developing melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Athletes spend a great deal of time outdoors, typically during peak hours of ultraviolet exposure. The frequent use of sunscreens and protective clothing will decrease the athlete's sun exposure. It is critical that the sports physician recognises common and uncommon skin disorders of the athlete. Knowledge of the treatment and prevention of various sports-related dermatoses results in prompt and appropriate care of the athlete.  
6114899	Role of sulphasalazine in the aetiology of folate deficiency in ulcerative colitis.	Gut	1981	test	1	13	0	Role of sulphasalazine in the aetiology of folate deficiency in ulcerative colitis.  Only two (2.5%) of 80 outpatients with histologically proven ulcerative colitis had folate deficiency associated with anaemia or macrocytosis. Mean folate absorption, measured using micrograms/kg body weight of a tritium-labelled physiological folate derivative, 5-methyltetrahydroteroylglutamic acid, in six newly diagnosed patients was 76.7% (normal greater than 95%) but fell to 69.4% after three months' treatment with sulphasalazine. Mean difference in individual patients was 7.5% +/- 5.2% (SD) (p less than 0.02). Mean folate absorption in four patients with megaloblastic anaemia or macrocytosis which developed during treatment with sulphasalazine was 66.3%. This rose to 82.4% after the drug was stopped. Mean difference in individual patients was 16.6 +/-  6.6% (SD) (p less than 0.001). All patients who developed anaemia or macrocytosis with sulphasalazine had additional reasons for folate deficiency. These included coeliac disease, severe nutritional deficiencies, and haemolysis. It was concluded that sulphasalazine impairs folate absorption but this only becomes significant if other reasons for folate deficiency are also present.  
17130879	Vitamin D replacement for cirrhosis-related bone disease.	Nature clinical practice. Gastroenterology & hepatology	2006	test	3	14	0	Vitamin D replacement for cirrhosis-related bone disease.  The osteoporotic fracture rate in patients with chronic liver disease is approximately twice that of age-matched, control individuals. About 66% of patients with moderately severe cirrhosis and 96% of patients awaiting liver transplantation have vitamin D deficiency. Studies have shown a strong correlation between vitamin D deficiency and bone density, particularly in the hip. Previous studies of vitamin D therapy in cirrhosis-related bone disease have had major design flaws. Most reports and guidelines on the treatment of hepatic bone disease have concluded that vitamin D deficiency does not have a significant pathogenetic role in the development of osteoporosis in cirrhosis, and that there is no evidence for a therapeutic effect of vitamin D supplementation. Conversely, it is generally recommended that patients with cirrhosis and low bone density should receive calcium and vitamin D supplementation; yet there is a paucity of reliable data on the optimal doses to use, as well as a lack of clearly demonstrated benefit. We believe that clinical trials of vitamin D therapy in these patients with liver disease are warranted. As low-dose oral supplementation often will not normalize vitamin D levels or suppress parathyroid hormone activity in cirrhotic patients, high-dose, parenteral vitamin D might be preferable, but further long-term studies are required to assess the benefits and safety of this approach.

Child abuse & neglect	1992	test	7	2	0	Long-term effects of incest: life events triggering mental disorders in female patients with sexual abuse in childhood.  The authors studied several psychosocial, psychosomatic, and psychodynamic factors in 33 female psychiatric patients who had been victims of incest. Abuse was almost exclusively severe and prolonged. Three quarters of the female patients had been abused by their biological fathers or stepfathers. Sexual abuse experiences in childhood are connected with feelings of anxiety, helplessness, and powerlessness. Together with a lack of support on the part of the mother, these experiences lead to ego weakness, an autoplastic mode of coping with aggression and to patterns of objectal relationships which predispose them to object loss. The links between a girl's traumatic experiences in relationships and her vulnerability to separation in later life and their importance for the incidence of mental disorders will be discussed on the basis of Bowlby's attachment theory.  
16259425	Improving urban air quality in China: Beijing case study.	Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (1995)	2005	test	25	0	0	Improving urban air quality in China: Beijing case study.  China is undergoing rapid urbanization because of unprecedented economic growth. As a result, many cities suffer from air pollution. Two-thirds of China's cities have not attained the ambient air quality standards applicable to urban residential areas (Grade II). Particulate matter (PM), rather than sulfur dioxide (SO2), is the major pollutant reflecting the shift from coal burning to mixed source pollution. In 2002, 63.2 and 22.4% of the monitored cities have PM and SO2 concentrations exceeding the Grade II standard, respectively. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) concentration kept a relatively stable level near the Grade II standard in the last decade and had an increasing potential in recent years because of the rapid motorization. In general, the air pollutants emission did not increase as quickly as the economic growth and energy consumption, and air quality in Chinese cities has improved to some extent. Beijing, a typical representative of rapidly developing cities, is an example to illustrate the possible options for urban air pollution control. Beijing's case provides hope that the challenges associated with improving air quality can be met during a period of explosive development and motorization.  
18596945	Abuse of medications employed for the treatment of ADHD: results from a large-scale community survey.	Medscape journal of medicine	2008	test	16	7	0	Abuse of medications employed for the treatment of ADHD: results from a large-scale community survey.  OBJECTIVE: The objective is to assess abuse of prescription and illicit stimulants among individuals being treated for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: A survey was distributed to patients enrolled in an ADHD treatment center. It included questions designed to gain information about demographics; ADHD treatment history; illicit drug use; and misuse of prescribed stimulant medications, including type of stimulant medication most frequently misused or abused, and how the stimulant was prepared and administered. RESULTS: A total of 545 subjects (89.2% with ADHD) were included in the survey. Results indicated that 14.3% of respondents abused prescription stimulants. Of these, 79.8% abused short-acting agents; 17.2% abused long-acting stimulants; 2.0% abused both short- and long-acting agents; and 1.0% abused other agents. The specific medications abused most often were mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall; 40.0%), mixed amphetamine salts extended release (Adderall XR; 14.2%), and methylphenidate (Ritalin; 15.0%), and the most common manner of stimulant abuse was crushing pills and snorting (75.0%). Survey results also showed that 39.1% of respondents used nonprescription stimulants, most often cocaine (62.2%), methamphetamine (4.8%), and both cocaine and amphetamine (31.1%). Choice of illicit drug was based on rapidity of high onset (43.5%), ease of acquisition (40.7%), ease of use (10.2%), and cost (5.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The risks for abuse of prescription and illicit stimulants are elevated among individuals being treated in an ADHD clinic. Prescription agents used most often are those with pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic characteristics that provide a rapid high. This suggests that long-acting stimulant preparations that have been developed for the treatment of ADHD may have lower abuse potential than short-acting formulations.

Saudi medical journal	2020	test	15	6	1	Role of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the upgrading of personal hygiene. A cross-sectional study in Saudi Arabia.  OBJECTIVES: To assess the role of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)  pandemic in improving personal hygiene in Saudi Arabia. Methods: We administered a questionnaire distributed online between 19 and 28 May 2020 to determine alterations in personal hygiene practices during this pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic phase. Results: We included 211 respondents from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in this study.  Improvement at different levels was detected in all examined personal hygiene items compared to the pre-pandemic stage. The percentages of respondents who always washed their hands after coming back home (34.1%), used soap to wash their hands (58.8%), used a hand sanitizer outside (5.2%), wore a face masks while outside (1.4%) and washed their hands before preparing and/or eating food (74.9%) was increased before the pandemic to 89.6%, 90%, 63.5%, 59.2% and 89.1% during the pandemic, respectively. The percentage of respondents who never shake hands with people they know increased from 0% before the pandemic to 62.6% during the pandemic. The mean duration of washing hands with soap significantly increased from 13.31 seconds before the pandemic to 28.01 seconds during the pandemic (p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a noticeable improvement in the personal hygiene habits in Saudi Arabia mainly those related to COVID-19 prevention.

Journal of orthodontics	2014	test	2	0	0	Change in frequency of the maxillary midline diastema appearing in photographs of Caucasian females in two fashion magazines from 2003 to 2012.  OBJECTIVES: To ascertain if there has been a change in the frequency of appearance of maxillary midline diastema in two leading women's fashion magazines over a decade. METHODS: Two observers counted the frequency of maxillary midline diastema that appeared in Caucasian female models featured in British Vogue and Glamour (UK). RESULTS: An increase in the frequency of maxillary midline diastema appearing in both publications was observed between 2003 and 2012. CONCLUSIONS: This change may indicate an increase in the acceptance of the maxillary midline diastema, which may in turn, influence orthodontic and aesthetic dentistry treatment planning.  
19023830	The impact of the 2006 Scottish smoke-free legislation on sales of nicotine replacement therapy.	Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco	2008	test	3	0	0	The impact of the 2006 Scottish smoke-free legislation on sales of nicotine replacement therapy.  This study used over-the-counter (OTC) sales of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to investigate the impact of the introduction of smoke-free legislation in Scotland in March 2006 on smoking cessation behaviour. The time series of NRT sales (units and value) in Scotland from 2004 to 2006 were compared with the same period for the rest of the UK, and analysed using an ARIMA time series model. There was a significant increase in units and value of NRT sales in Scotland in the first 6 months of 2006 (p< or =0.001), apparent from January and prior to the introduction of the smoking ban, with no comparable increase for the rest of the UK. There was no significant increase in NRT sales for the second half of 2006. These data suggest an increase in smoking cessation behaviour in the period immediately before the introduction of smoke-free legislation, but this was not sustained beyond the first few months of the post-legislation period.  
1312238	Absorption of color additives and settling volume in water of blue-green alga, ishikurage (Nostoc commune).	Plant foods for human nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands)	1992	test	19	0	0	Absorption of color additives and settling volume in water of blue-green alga, ishikurage (Nostoc commune).  The properties of ishikurage (Nostoc commune) and other algae were compared. Ishikurage and suizenji nori (Aphanothece sacrum) absorbed much more amaranth than others. They have a high settling volume (SV) in water. The high SV of ishikurage is attributable to its neutral detergent fiber (NDF). The acid detergent fiber (ADF) from the alga had a high amaranth absorption. However the absorption by the ADF did not explain the absorption by ishikurage. The results suggest that ishikurage may have a nutritional significance as a source of dietary fiber.  
32839678	The Association Between Cannabis Use and Schizophrenia: Causative or Curative? A Systematic Review.	Cureus	2020	test	20	16	5	The Association Between Cannabis Use and Schizophrenia: Causative or Curative? A Systematic Review.  Marijuana is one of the most abused substances in the world. Marijuana is getting legalized around the world. So, it is crucial to understand its effect on our mental health. Its impact on the schizophrenia spectrum needs our special attention. Even though marijuana has been around for a long time, its exact effects are still unknown. Schizophrenia is a chronic illness affecting approximately 20 million people worldwide. Schizophrenia and cannabis seem to have a close relationship, and we want to explore this. We want to know if marijuana is causing, exacerbating, or treating schizophrenia. This systematic review explores this question. We searched online resources like PubMed, PubMed Central, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar for systematic reviews, traditional reviews, randomized controlled trials, and meta-analysis on cannabis and schizophrenia/ psychosis. We included human studies published in peer-reviewed journals in the English language in the last five years. After reviewing 96 initial results of our search, we excluded 25 duplicates, 29 abstracts, and 18 irrelevant articles. We did a quality assessment for the remaining 24 studies using various quality assessment tools. After the quality assessment, we found 12 articles were of low quality and excluded those. We included the remaining 12 final studies in our systematic review. Out of these 12 studies, five were traditional reviews, two systematic reviews, two meta-analysis, and three observational studies. Six of the articles were on cannabis's effect on just schizophrenia or psychotic disorder. The other six included schizophrenia plus other psychiatric or neurological illnesses. Ten of the studies had data supporting the causative link between cannabis and schizophrenia. Eight records had data supporting the exacerbating effect of marijuana. Six studies had data supporting the therapeutic effect of the cannabidiol (CBD) component of cannabis. From the current data, we can conclude that the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) component of cannabis can be the main culprit causing psychosis and schizophrenia in the at-risk population. THC can also be the one exacerbating symptoms and causing an adverse prognosis in already diagnosed patients. Even though CBD shows therapeutic effects and THC opposing effects, the data is minimal and low safety and efficacy warrants more research. The relation between cannabis and schizophrenia needs further investigation. We need more case-control studies and clinical trials with a larger population to get conclusive data.  
34348394	Should Insulin-dependent Diabetic Patients Be Screened for Malnutrition Before Total Joint Arthroplasty? A Cohort at Risk.	The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons	2021	test	10	10	4	Should Insulin-dependent Diabetic Patients Be Screened for Malnutrition Before Total Joint Arthroplasty? A Cohort at Risk.  INTRODUCTION: The association of malnutrition in the morbidly obese cohort has led to recommendations for preoperative screening before total joint arthroplasty (TJA). However, despite the connection between diabetes and poor nutrition, preoperative screening in the diabetic cohort has not been closely examined. This study compared malnutrition risk between diabetic patients and morbidly obese patients undergoing TJA and investigated the association of malnutrition on 30-day postoperative TJA outcomes in the diabetic cohort. METHODS: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried, and primary TJA patients were identified for inclusion. Patients were stratified by body mass index and diabetes, and outcomes were reported as two composite groups: complications and infections in the 30-day postoperative period. Univariate and multivariate regressions were used for the analysis. RESULTS: Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) were at a high risk of being malnourished in both the morbidly obese and nonmorbidly obese populations (frequencies of 11.9% and 9.9%, respectively). Patients with IDDM, but without morbid obesity, were 1.5x more often malnourished than morbidly obese patients without diabetes mellitus (9.9% versus 6.4%, respectively, P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis among patients with co-occurring diabetes and malnutrition, patients with IDDM were at greatest risk for postoperative complications and infection (odds ratio 2.081 [1.652, 2.621]; P < 0.001 and odds ratio 1.894 [1.231, 2.913]; P = 0.004, respectively). DISCUSSION: Patients with IDDM are at high risk for malnutrition, and increased vigilance should be maintained in this cohort before TJA to optimize outcomes. Future studies should further investigate the utility of preoperative malnutrition screening in this cohort.  
8642155	A study of the characteristics of the dementia patients and caregivers in dementia-nonspecific adult day care programs.	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society	1996	test	12	17	0	A study of the characteristics of the dementia patients and caregivers in dementia-nonspecific adult day care programs.  OBJECTIVE: To determine if basic differences exist between the patients and caregivers of a representative group of dementia-nonspecific medical versus social adult day care centers with specific programs for dementia patients. DESIGN: A telephone interview questionnaire survey. SETTING: North Central North Carolina. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 242 adult day care dementia patients and caregivers from three medical and three social nondementia-specific adult day care centers. MEASUREMENTS: Dementia patient variables: Day care subtype (medical or social); length of stay; number of days attended; age; sex; race; educational level; marital status; religious affiliation; income; living status; number of medical conditions; number of prescription medications; function; ADL status (walking, eating, bathing, dressing, grooming, toileting); continence status; number and type of abnormal behaviors; formal help status (hospitalization during day care, part or full-time nursing home attendance, or home healthcare assistance); transportation; and financial assistance. Caregiver variables: day care subtype; age; sex; race; educational level; marital status; religious affiliation; income; number of medical conditions; number of prescription medications; informal help (family friends or other non-paid help); paid help (friend, other, home health, or nursing home); relationship to patient; employment status; and level of caregiver burden. MAIN RESULTS: There were 144 medical and 62 social adult day care dementia patients and caregivers who agreed to participate. The average age of the patient was 77.9 years (SD +/- 8.4), and that of the caregiver was 57.7 years (SD +/- 13.9); 68.4% of the patients and 75.4% of the caregivers were females. Dementia patients in the medical subtype day care had a shorter length of stay than social day care patients; this did not reach statistical significance. There were significantly more white patients and caregivers in the medical than in the social subtype day care, 83.1% versus 50% and 83.3% versus 50.8%, respectively. Dementia patients of the medical subtype also had significantly more education, income, less function, and more symptoms of depression than dementia patients in the social subtype. Dementia patients of the medical subtype also had more abnormal psychological behaviors than their social subtype counterparts, with borderline significance (P = .071). There were more married caregivers in the medical subtype than in the social subtype day care. Caregivers of dementia patients in the medical subtype had significantly more paid help and caregiver burden than did caregivers of dementia patients in the social subtype. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, there appear to be key differences between the dementia patients and caregivers of medical versus social adult day care centers as to demographic and health-related variables. The differences in demographic variables appear to be associated with socioeconomic factors, whereas the decreased function and greater number of depressive symptoms of the medical dementia patients may reflect poorer health as reflected by the greater amount of paid help and increased caregiver burden experienced by the caregivers of medical dementia patients. These findings should be verified in prospective studies.  
33531680	A longitudinal study of sleep, weight status, and weight-related behaviors: Childhood Obesity Study in China Mega-cities.	Pediatric research	2021	test	31	6	4	A longitudinal study of sleep, weight status, and weight-related behaviors: Childhood Obesity Study in China Mega-cities.  BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to examine correlates of sleep and assess its associations with weight status and related behaviors. METHODS: Data were collected in 2015-2017 for 3298 children aged 6-17 years and their parents in 5 Chinese mega-cities. One thousand six hundred and ninety-one children with measured weight, height, and waist circumference in >=2 surveys were included for longitudinal data analyses. Sleep and behaviors were self-reported. RESULTS: Cross-sectional data analyses found that older (beta = -0.29, 95% CI: -0.32, -0.27) and secondary school children (beta = -1.22, 95% CI: -1.31, -1.13) reported shorter sleep than their counterparts. Children with >=college-educated (vs <college) fathers (beta = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.31) or mothers (beta = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.29) reported longer sleep. Longer sleep was longitudinally associated with less sugar-sweetened beverage intake (beta = -0.12 days/h sleep, 95% CI: -0.20, -0.03), more healthy snacks intake (beta = 0.13 days/h sleep, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.25) and having breakfast (beta = 0.07 days/h sleep, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.11), and shorter total screen time (beta = -0.22 h/h sleep, 95% CI: -0.65, -0.21) and surfing the internet/computer time (beta = -0.06 h/h sleep, 95% CI: -0.09, -0.04) among all children. Longer sleep reduced the risk of central obesity (OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.85) for girls. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep among urban Chinese children varies by demographic factors. Longer sleep is associated with healthier weight-related behaviors and lower central obesity risk. IMPACT: Longer sleep was observed in younger, primary school children and children with college-educated parents. Longer sleep increased healthier weight-related behaviors and reduced general and central obesity risk. Provides data on the correlates of sleep duration of children. Gives insights on longitudinal relationships of sleep duration with weight-related behaviors and obesity risk. Findings help inform sleep interventions to increase sleep duration to prevent childhood obesity and unhealthy weight-related behaviors in urban settings of developing countries.  
23737423	The efficacy of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in treating depressive and anxiety disorders: a meta-analysis of direct comparisons.	World psychiatry : official journal of the World Psychiatric Association (WPA)	2013	test	9	11	3	The efficacy of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in treating depressive and anxiety disorders: a meta-analysis of direct comparisons.  Although psychotherapy and antidepressant medication are efficacious in the treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders, it is not known whether they are equally efficacious for all types of disorders, and whether all types of psychotherapy and antidepressants are equally efficacious for each disorder. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies in which psychotherapy and antidepressant medication were directly compared in the treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders. Systematic searches in bibliographical databases resulted in 67 randomized trials, including 5,993 patients that met inclusion criteria, 40 studies focusing on depressive disorders and 27 focusing on anxiety disorders. The overall effect size indicating the difference between psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy after treatment in all disorders was g=0.02 (95% CI: -0.07 to 0.10), which was not statistically significant. Pharmacotherapy was significantly more efficacious than psychotherapy in dysthymia (g=0.30), and psychotherapy was significantly more efficacious than pharmacotherapy in obsessive-compulsive disorder (g=0.64). Furthermore, pharmacotherapy was significantly more efficacious than non-directive counseling (g=0.33), and psychotherapy was significantly more efficacious than pharmacotherapy with tricyclic antidepressants (g=0.21). These results remained significant when we controlled for other characteristics of the studies in multivariate meta-regression analysis, except for the differential effects in dysthymia, which were no longer statistically significant.  
1864491	Hyperinsulinaemia as a predictor of coronary heart disease mortality in a healthy population: the Paris Prospective Study, 15-year follow-up.	Diabetologia	1991	test	1	13	1	Hyperinsulinaemia as a predictor of coronary heart disease mortality in a healthy population: the Paris Prospective Study, 15-year follow-up.  The Paris Prospective Study is a long-term, large-scale study of the factors predicting coronary heart disease. The first follow-up examination included, for subjects not known as having diabetes mellitus, a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test with measurement of plasma insulin and glucose levels, fasting and 2 h post-load. Between 1968 and 1973, 6903 men aged 43-54 years were thus examined. Causes of death were ascertained within this group after 15 years of mean follow-up. The baseline variables were tested as predictors of death from coronary heart disease by a Cox regression analysis. Significant independent predictors of coronary heart disease death were: systolic blood pressure, number of cigarettes per day, plasma cholesterol level, and 2 h post-load plasma insulin level when entered as a categorical variable (below or above 452 pmol/l. i.e. the lower limit of the fifth quintile of the distribution). This dichotomization was performed to account for the non-linear univariate distribution of deaths with increasing post-load insulin values. Fasting plasma insulin level was not an independent predictor of death by coronary heart disease over this long-term follow-up. Levels of blood glucose were not significant independent predictors of death by coronary heart disease when plasma insulin levels were included in the model. The same applied to abnormalities of glucose tolerance when the 125 men with known non-insulin-treated diabetes at baseline were added to the group. Under the assumption that hyperinsulinaemia is a marker of insulin resistance, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that insulin resistance is associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease mortality. However, it is doubtful that circulating insulin per se is a direct cause of arterial complications.  
28834509	Proximity to School and Physical Activity Among Middle School Girls: The Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls Study.	Journal of physical activity & health	2006	test	10	0	0	Proximity to School and Physical Activity Among Middle School Girls: The Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls Study.  BACKGROUND: Proximity to routine destinations is an important correlate of physical activity. We examined the association between distance from school and physical activity in adolescent girls. METHODS: We mapped the addresses of 1554 sixth-grade girls who participated in the Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls (TAAG) Study and calculated the shortest distance from home to school along the street network. Using a hierarchical design we examined the association between MET-weighted moderate to vigorous physical activity (MW- MVPA) and distance to school, while controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: Distance to school was inversely associated with weekday MW- MVPA for middle school girls. For every mile the girls lived from their schools, they engaged in an average of 13 fewer MET-weighted minutes per week. CONCLUSIONS: Distance to school is inversely associated with MW-MVPA. The most adversely affected girls lived more than 5 miles from school. Time spent commuting could explain reduced time for physical activity.  
23895466	Investigating electronic word-of-mouth effects on online discussion forums: the role of perceived positive electronic word-of-mouth review credibility.	Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking	2013	test	0	0	0	Investigating electronic word-of-mouth effects on online discussion forums: the role of perceived positive electronic word-of-mouth review credibility.  Electronic word of mouth (eWOM) has been an important factor influencing consumer purchase decisions. Using the ABC model of attitude, this study proposes a model to explain how eWOM affects online discussion forums. Specifically, we propose that platform (Web site reputation and source credibility) and customer (obtaining buying-related information and social orientation through information) factors influence purchase intentions via perceived positive eWOM review credibility, as well as product and Web site attitudes in an online community context. A total of 353 online discussion forum users in an online community (Fashion Guide) in Taiwan were recruited, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the research hypotheses. The results indicate that Web site reputation, source credibility, obtaining buying-related information, and social orientation through information positively influence perceived positive eWOM review credibility. In turn, perceived positive eWOM review credibility directly influences purchase intentions and also indirectly influences purchase intentions via product and Web site attitudes. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings.  
30443786	Functional Interactions Between Sleep and Circadian Rhythms in Learning and Learning Disabilities.	Handbook of experimental pharmacology	2019	test	15	7	0	Functional Interactions Between Sleep and Circadian Rhythms in Learning and Learning Disabilities.  The propensity for sleep is timed by the circadian system. Many studies have shown that learning and memory performance is affected by circadian phase. And, of course it is well established that critical processes of memory consolidation occur during and depend on sleep. This chapter presents evidence that sleep and circadian rhythms do not just have separate influences on learning and memory that happen to coincide because of the circadian timing of sleep, but rather sleep and circadian systems have a critical functional interaction in the processes of memory consolidation. The evidence comes primarily from research on two models of learning disability: Down's syndrome model mice and Siberian hamsters. The Down's syndrome model mouse (Ts65Dn) has severe learning disability that has been shown to be due to GABAergic over-inhibition. Short-term, chronic therapies with GABAA antagonists restore learning ability in these mice long-term, but only if the antagonist treatments are given during the dark or sleep phase of the daily rhythm. The Siberian hamster is a model circadian animal except for the fact that a light treatment that gives the animal a phase advance on one day and a phase delay on the next day can result in total circadian arrhythmia for life. Once arrhythmic, the hamsters cannot learn. Learning, but not rhythmicity, is restored by short-term chronic treatment with GABA antagonists. Like many other species, if these hamsters are made arrhythmic by SCN lesion, their learning is unaffected. However, if made arrhythmic and learning disabled by the light treatment, subsequent lesions of their SCNs restore learning. SCN lesions also appear to restore learning in the Ts65Dn mice. The collective work on these two animal models of learning disability suggests that the circadian system modulates neuroplasticity. Our hypothesis is that a previously unrecognized function of the circadian system is to dampen neuroplasticity during the sleep phase to stabilize memory transcripts during their transfer to long-term memory. Thus, sleep and circadian systems have integrated roles to play in memory consolidation and do not just have separate but coincident influences on that process.  
31176378	Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its association with metabolic derangements among children with obesity.	BMC pediatrics	2019	test	0	16	0	Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its association with metabolic derangements among children with obesity.  BACKGROUND: It is known that obesity is associated with vitamin D deficiency and observational studies have shown vitamin D deficiency to be linked with the development of type 2 diabetes. There are no comprehensive data regarding vitamin D deficiency in children with obesity in Sri Lanka and the objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency and its association with metabolic derangements among children with obesity. METHODOLOGY: Two hundred and two children between 5 and 15 years of age attending the obesity clinic Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) were recruited excluding those having possible secondary causes for obesity. Blood was drawn after 12-h overnight fast for fasting blood glucose(FBG), lipid profile, serum insulin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT),aspartate aminotransferase(AST), Vitamin D, parathyroid hormone(PTH),high sensitivity C reactive protein(hs-CRP). Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was done with 2 h random blood glucose. Anthropometry, blood pressure were measured, and body fat mass was assessed using bio-impedance. RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency (< 20 ng/ml) was seen in 152(75.2%) children and 43(21.3%) had insufficient (20-30 ng/ml) levels. Skin fold thickness, fasting and post-glucose insulin, HOMA-IR, PTH, LDL, Serum cholesterol and hs-CRP showed statistically significant negative correlations with Vitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency was significantly high in Sri Lankan children with obesity and showed significant negative correlations with indicators of insulin resistance and adiposity.  
32095174	The Opioid System and Food Intake: Use of Opiate Antagonists in Treatment of Binge Eating Disorder and Abnormal Eating Behavior.	Journal of clinical medicine research	2020	test	20	22	5	"The Opioid System and Food Intake: Use of Opiate Antagonists in Treatment of Binge Eating Disorder and Abnormal Eating Behavior.  Eating disorders (EDs) and substance use disorders (SUDs) commonly co-occur, especially in conjunction with affective syndromes, yet little is known about opiate abuse and ED symptoms in patients on naltrexone-bupropion therapy. Moreover, evidence suggests that the opioid system can also be regarded as one of the major systems regulating the anticipatory processes preceding binge eating episodes. The lack of evidence in the effectiveness of psychotherapy treatment in addition to psychotropic mediations compounds the difficulties in stabilizing individuals with EDs. This article aims to exhaustively review literature relating to the use of opioid antagonists in the management of binge eating disorder (BED) and other abnormal eating habits and how this can be augmented by the use of psychological approaches to come up with the most effective therapy or combination of therapies to manage these conditions. Although this approach is promising, it has not been evaluated. A review of the literature pertaining to the use of naltrexone in patients with EDs was performed through PubMed, PsycINFO and MEDLINE. We selected 63 relevant articles published between 1981 and 2018 and those written in English. Search terms included ""Opioid antagonists"", ""naltrexone"", ""bupropion"" and ""Psychotherapy"" each combined with ""Binge Eating Disorder"", ""Bulimia Nervosa"", ""Anorexia Nervosa"", ""Eating Disorder"", ""EDNOS"" and ""Obesity"". While working with these articles, we also identified several problems related to use of these methods in real clinical practice. Seventy-seven articles were reviewed, and 63 were selected for inclusion. Data obtained from these sources confirmed that the blockade of opioid receptors diminishes food intake. More recent findings also indicate that the combination of bupropion and naltrexone can induce weight loss. Augmentation of this by introducing psychotherapy may lead to better outcomes. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was the most frequently recommended psychotherapy intervention, showing efficacy for EDs and chemical addictions as documented by most of the studies, but with uncertain efficacy when utilized as augmentation strategy. There are limited data supporting the use of psychotherapy in augmentation of standard therapy in ED; however, there is evidence to support that psychotherapy is safe in this population and has been effective in cases of patients with opiate addiction with and without psychiatric comorbidities as well as BED. More research is needed to establish treatment guidelines. Combining pharmacotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic interventions leads to the achievement of a better outcome in managing patients with EDs. Involving families or the use of support groups increases chances of adherence to the prescribed interventions resulting in higher rates of remission. However, it is clear that all of these interventions must occur in the context of a comprehensive treatment program. We believe that patient-specific psychotherapy may not only facilitate the treatment process, but also cause significant alterations in eating pattern. This approach for BED may lead to more significant treatment outcomes, but this possibility must be tested in larger samples.  "
15333876	The tobacco industry's use of Wall Street analysts in shaping policy.	Tobacco control	2004	test	0	0	0	The tobacco industry's use of Wall Street analysts in shaping policy.  OBJECTIVE: To document how the tobacco industry has used Wall Street analysts to further its public policy objectives. METHODS: Searching tobacco documents available on the internet, newspaper articles, and transcripts of public hearings. RESULTS: The tobacco industry used nominally independent Wall Street analysts as third parties to support the tobacco industry's legislative agenda at both national and state levels in the USA. The tobacco industry has, for example, edited the testimony of at least one analyst before he testified to the US Senate Judiciary Committee, while representing himself as independent of the industry. CONCLUSION: The tobacco industry has used undisclosed collaboration with Wall Street analysts, as they have used undisclosed relationships with research scientists and academics, to advance the interests of the tobacco industry in public policy.

Journal of orofacial orthopedics = Fortschritte der Kieferorthopadie : Organ/official journal Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Kieferorthopadie	1997	test	4	6	0	Orthodontic treatment and temporomandibular disorder: is there a relationship? Part 2: Clinical implications.  Although a review of the current literature does not reveal compelling evidence for the claim that orthodontic treatment prevents, causes, or cures temporomandibular disorders (TMD), the currently available clinical studies devoted to this topic share some methodological weaknesses, some of which are discussed in the present article. Another purpose of this paper is to extend the current understanding about the relationship between orthodontics and TMD to situations occurring in routine clinical practice. By doing so, we provide suggestions that are intended to help the orthodontist in decision-making when he or she deals with a patient who is in need of orthodontic treatment for dental or skeletal reasons, but has a history of TMD, or who develops TMD signs and symptoms during or after treatment.  
31336509	Ketogenic diets potentially reverse Type II diabetes and ameliorate clinical depression: A case study.	Diabetes & metabolic syndrome	2019	test	9	16	15	Ketogenic diets potentially reverse Type II diabetes and ameliorate clinical depression: A case study.  Efficacious adherence to treatment protocol predicts metabolic control among Type 2 diabetics (T2DM) [1-4]; however, few healthcare systems employ individualized strategies to mediate the comorbidity of T2DM with other chronic disease states. A clinically prescribed ketogenic diet, patient-centered nutritional education and high intensity interval training (HIIT), girded by solution-focused psychotherapy, modulate significant improvements in the clinical biomarkers associated with concurring T2DM and clinical depression [5-15]. Relevant metabolic change was noted in the following measures: HOMA-IR, triglyceride/HDL ratio, HgA1c, fasting insulin, fasting glucose, fasting triglycerides, LDL, VLDL, HDL, total cholesterol and C-reactive protein. The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) along with clinical interview and the mental status exam showed notable change in the patient's depressive symptoms; likewise, her self-efficacy score normalized, as measured by the General Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (GSE) and the Metabolic Syndrome Compliance Questionnaire (MSC). The case study highlights a 65-year old female who presented with a 26-year history of dually-diagnosed Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and major depressive disorder (MDD). The patient was prescribed a ketogenic diet (KD), clinically formulated from her resting metabolic rate, body fat percentage and lean body mass, together with weekly nutrition education, high intensity interval training (matched to her cardiovascular conditioning), and eight 45-minute solution-focused psychotherapy sessions. Intervention goals included improved insulin sensitivity evaluated by the HOMA-IR, sustained glycemic control measured via HgA1c, reduced cardiovascular risk via the triglyceride/HDL ratio, and improved depressive symptoms with increased self-efficacy monitored by the PHQ-9 and GSE/MSC. The results of the 12-week intervention were statistically significant. The patient's HgA1c dropped out of diabetic range (8.0%) and normalized at 5.4%. Her average daily glucose measurements declined from 216 mg/dL to 96 mg/dL; the HOMA-IR and triglyceride/HDL ratios improved by 75%. Her marker for clinical depression and measurement of self-efficacy normalized. The 12-week individualized treatment intervention served to functionally reverse 26 years of T2DM, ameliorate two and half decades of chronic depressive disorder and empower/equip the patient with a new experience of hope and success.  
24645564	[Long term regular physical activity as a factor modifying the incidence of subclinical atherosclerosis in occupationally active men].	Medycyna pracy	2013	test	13	6	2	[Long term regular physical activity as a factor modifying the incidence of subclinical atherosclerosis in occupationally active men].  BACKGROUND: Optimal dose of physical activity in the prevention of atherosclerosis remains unclear. The purpose of the study was to investigate the influence of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) on selected indices of atherosclerosis in the working-age population of men. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out in a cohort of asymptomatic men participating in follow-up examinations in the Healthy Men Clinic, Medical University of Lodz. Of the 132 men who responded to the invitation to participate in this study, 101 men were eligible for the non-invasive assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis indices. Self-reported PA was assessed by interviewer-administered validated questionnaires. During the latest follow-up subclinical atherosclerosis was measured by assessing the coronary artery calcification (CAC), the carotid inti ma-media thickness (IMT) and the reactive hyperemia index (RHI) using peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT2000). RESULTS: Preliminary results have been elaborated in the group of 60 men (mean age: 61.3 +/- 8.85 years). The participants were predominantly white collar workers with low occupational LTPA. The cohort was divided into 3 groups according to the LTPA level. Both dose and energy expenditure of recreational PA significantly correlated with CA, IMT and RHI in the whole cohort. The majority of men maintained their baseline PA throughout the observation period. Men with the highest LTPA level had significantly lower mean CAC, IMT (p < 0.01), and significantly higher mean RHI (p < 0.05) compared to the least active group. On final examination men with high PA had also the most favorable cardiovascular profile. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results indicate the protective effect of high LTPA level in the context of subclinical atherosclerosis in men.  
24672690	Preoperative evaluation for lung cancer resection.	Journal of thoracic disease	2014	test	7	9	7	Preoperative evaluation for lung cancer resection.  During the last decades lung cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide for both sexes. Even though cigarette smoking has been proved to be the main causative factor, many other agents (e.g., occupational exposure to asbestos or heavy metals, indoor exposure to radon gas radiation, particulate air pollution) have been associated with its development. Recently screening programs proved to reduce mortality among heavy-smokers although establishment of such strategies in everyday clinical practice is much more difficult and unknown if it is cost effective compared to other neoplasms (e.g., breast or prostate cancer). Adding severe comorbidities (coronary heart disease, COPD) to the above reasons as cigarette smoking is a common causative factor, we could explain the low surgical resection rates (approximately 20-30%) for lung cancer patients. Three clinical guidelines reports of different associations have been published (American College of Chest Physisians, British Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society/European Society of Thoracic Surgery) providing detailed algorithms for preoperative assessment. In the current mini review, we will comment on the preoperative evaluation of lung cancer patients.  
11034689	Psychotherapy for bulimia nervosa and binging.	The Cochrane database of systematic reviews	2000	test	26	14	4	"Psychotherapy for bulimia nervosa and binging.  BACKGROUND: Bulimia nervosa and like syndromes, such as binge eating disorder, are common in young Western women. A specific psychotherapy, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been developed for the treatment of bulimia nervosa. Other psychotherapies, some from a different theroretical framework, some modifications of CBT are also used. OBJECTIVES: The review aims to evaluate the psychotherapeutic treatments for those with binge eating syndromes, that have been tested in randomised controlled trials. Specifically, CBT therapy is compared with waiting list or a non-treatment group, any other psychotherapy, CBT in a ""pure self-help"" form and CBT augmented by exposure and response therapy. As well, the review aims to evaluate the evidence for the efficacy of other psychotherapies when compared to a no treatment control group and to evaluate the evidence for the efficacy of other psychotherapies when compared to a 'placebo' therapy. SEARCH STRATEGY: Handsearch of The International Journal of Eating Disorders since its first issue; database searches of MEDLINE, EXTRAMED, EMBASE, PSYCHLIT, CURRENT CONTENTS, LILACS, SCISEARCH, The Cochrane Collaboration Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Database of Trials; citation list searching and personal approaches to authors communication are used. SELECTION CRITERIA: All studies that have tested any form of psychotherapy for adult patients with non-purging bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and/or EDNOS of a bulimic type, and which have applied a randomised controlled and standardized outcome methodology, are sought for the purpose of this review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data are entered into a spreadsheet programme, and into the REVMAN analysis program. Relative risk analyses are conducted of binary outcome data. The relative risk analysis is used rather than the odds ratio as the outcome measures proposed are not measuring a rare event (such as death) and the total number of studies is small. Standardized mean difference analyses are conducted of continuous variable outcome data, as the continuous outcome measures are not consistent across studies. Sensitivity analyses are conducted of a number of measures of trial quality. Data were not reported in such a way to permitsubgroup analyses, but the effect of treatment on depressive symptoms, psychosocial and/or interpersonal functioning, general psychiatric symptoms and weight is examined where possible. Chi-square tests for homogeneity are done, at 5% level of significance, using a fixed effects model. Funnel plots to evaluate presence of publication bias are completed and available in a text file upon request. MAIN RESULTS: To date, more than 1360 trials have been generated by searching and 63 trials have been evaluated in detail. Because of a relatively high number of exclusions (n=12) the trial inclusion criteria were broadened to include those with non-blinded outcome assessment, providing 25 trials for analyses. Because of incomplete published and available data, at best up to 10 studies had data available for any single analysis. The maximum number of total patients included in a single analysis is 543. The majority of studies (21) evaluate patients with bulimia nervosa of a purging type. CBT is superior to waiting list controls with respect to abstinence from binge eating (RR 0.64 CI.53-.78). CBT just fails to be significantly superior to other psychotherapies with respect to abstinence from binge eating (RR.79, CI.61-1.04). CBT in a full or less intensive form is not significantly superior to CBT in a pure self-help form. Augmentation of CBT with exposure therapy is not more effective than CBT alone. Non CBT-psychotherapies also have significantly greater abstinence rates in comparisons with wait-list controls, but there is a paucity of such studies (RR 0.67, CI.56-.81, n=3 studies). Funnel plots suggest a bias towards publication of positive outcome studies only. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is small body of evidence for the efficacy of cognitive-behaviour therapy in bulimia nervosa and similar syndromes, but the quality of trials is very variable (e.g. the majority are not blinded) and sample sizes are often very small. More trials are needed, particularly for binge eating disorder and other EDNOS syndromes, and evaluating other psychotherapies and less intensive psychotherapies.  "
17127551	Concurrent cannabis use during treatment for comorbid ADHD and cocaine dependence: effects on outcome.	The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse	2006	test	9	14	0	Concurrent cannabis use during treatment for comorbid ADHD and cocaine dependence: effects on outcome.  Cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance in the United States with especially high prevalence of use among those with psychiatric disorders. Few studies have examined the relationship between concurrent cannabis use and treatment outcome among patients receiving treatment for comorbid substance abuse and psychiatric disorders. This study investigated the effects of cannabis use on treatment retention and abstinence from cocaine among cocaine dependent patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Cocaine dependent patients diagnosed with current ADHD (DSM-IV, N = 92) aged 25 to 51 participated in a randomized clinical trial of methylphenidate for treatment of ADHD and cocaine dependence in an outpatient setting. The majority of patients (69%) used cannabis during treatment. Results suggest that moderate/intermittent cannabis users had greater retention rates compared to abstainers and consistent users (p = .02). This study is the first to examine concurrent cannabis use in cocaine dependent patients diagnosed with ADHD.  
12817552	Representations of therapists by patients with personality disorders.	American journal of psychotherapy	2003	test	3	16	0	Representations of therapists by patients with personality disorders.  The purpose of this study was to investigate attributes of mental representations of therapists by patients with specific personality disorders (PDs), schizotypal (STPD), borderline (BPD), avoidant (AVPD), and obsessive-compulsive (OCPD), and a comparison group with Major Depressive Disorder and no PD (MDD). The Therapist Representation Inventory-II (TRI) measured characteristics of participants' extra-session thoughts about their therapists. Results showed that patients with STPD had the highest level of mental involvement with therapy outside the session, missing their therapists and wishing for friendship, while also feeling aggressive or negative. Patients with BPD exhibited the most difficulty in creating a benign image of the therapist. Variables such as gender, co-occurring Axis I disorders, and amount of individual psychotherapy received were significant covariates for a number of analyses. The importance of understanding the internal dynamics of patients' thoughts about their treatment relationship was underscored.  
30994479	Leisure-time cross-country skiing is associated with lower incidence of hypertension: a prospective cohort study.	Journal of hypertension	2019	test	12	13	7	Leisure-time cross-country skiing is associated with lower incidence of hypertension: a prospective cohort study.  OBJECTIVE: The prospective relationship between cross-country skiing and hypertension is uncertain. We aimed to assess the associations of leisure time cross-country skiing habits with incident hypertension in a general population. METHODS: The frequency, average duration, and intensity of leisure cross-country skiing were assessed at baseline using a 12-month physical activity questionnaire in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease prospective study of 1809 middle-aged men without hypertension. Hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] were calculated. RESULTS: New onset diagnosis of hypertension was observed in 279 participants during a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 24.7 (18.1-26.8) years. Total volume and duration of cross-country skiing were continuously associated with hypertension risk. In analyses adjusted for hypertension risk factors, when compared with men with no cross-country skiing activity, the hazard ratios (95% CIs) of incident hypertension were 0.75 (0.57-0.99) and 0.57 (0.41-0.79) for men who did 1-200 and more than 200 MET hours/year of cross-country skiing, respectively. Compared with men with no cross-country skiing activity, the corresponding adjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) for incident hypertension were 0.72 (0.55-0.94) and 0.62 (0.44-0.86) for men who did 1-60 min/week and more than 60 min/week of cross-country skiing, respectively. In subsidiary analyses, there were age-adjusted associations of cross-country skiing habits with risk of stroke and acute coronary events, but these were attenuated on further adjustment for several confounders. Cross-country skiing habits were associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSION: Total volume as well as duration of leisure time cross-country skiing are each continuously, inversely, and independently associated with future risk of hypertension in a white male population.  
30338182	Adding Psychotherapy to the Naltrexone Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder: Meta-analytic Review.	Cureus	2018	test	11	6	0	Adding Psychotherapy to the Naltrexone Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder: Meta-analytic Review.  Background It remains unclear if naltrexone combined with psychotherapy is superior to naltrexone alone in treating alcohol use disorders (AUD). The current meta-analysis examined the hypothesis that psychotherapy is a significant moderator that influences AUD-related outcomes and that naltrexone combined with psychotherapy is associated with significantly better AUD-related outcomes than naltrexone alone. Methods A total of 30 studies (Nnaltrexone = 2317; Nplacebo = 2056) were included. Random effects model meta-analyses were carried out for each of the studied outcomes. Subsequently, the random effects model pooled estimates from studies with and without psychotherapy were compared using a Wald test. A mixed-effect model, incorporating psychotherapy as a moderator, was used to examine the impact of psychotherapy on treatment outcomes. Results Naltrexone had a significant treatment effect on abstinence relapse and Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase levels, but not cravings. The pooled estimates for studies with and without psychotherapy were not significantly different for any of the studied outcomes. Psychotherapy was not a significant moderator in the mixed effects models for any of the studied outcomes. Conclusions Naltrexone treatment is efficacious in reducing alcohol consumption, but not reducing cravings. Adding psychotherapy on top naltrexone did not result in any significant additional benefit for AUD patients.  
28735816	Lower risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes with health checkup with lifestyle education: Japan Ningen Dock study.	Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD	2017	test	8	14	4	Lower risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes with health checkup with lifestyle education: Japan Ningen Dock study.  BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To investigate whether the progression from prediabetes to diabetes is lower among those who undertake Ningen Dock (comprehensive health checkups with lifestyle education and doctor's consultation) than those who undertake basic mandatory occupational health checkups. METHODS AND RESULTS: Subjects aged 30-69 years with complete annual data from 2008 to 2012 for either Ningen Dock or basic health checkups were enrolled. Subjects with prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose 100-125 mg/dl or HbA1c 5.7-6.4%) at baseline were selected (14,928 in the comprehensive group and 10,433 in the basic group). The incidence of diabetes (fasting plasma glucose >= 126 mg/dl, HbA1c >= 6.5% or taking glucose-lowering drugs) and the reduction of risk factors were compared. After 4 years, 3226 cases of diabetes occurred among 25,361 subjects with prediabetes. The incidence of diabetes was lower in the comprehensive group than the basic group (2.9 vs. 3.8 cases/100 person-years, hazard ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.68-0.81 after adjustment). Moreover, more overweight subjects controlled their body mass index (16.2% vs. 13.2%) and more began a daily exercise habit (11.8% vs. 8.5%) in the comprehensive group than in the basic group. The incidence of diabetes was lower in subjects who could control their weight or start daily exercise at year 1 in the comprehensive group. CONCLUSION: Progression from prediabetes to diabetes was significantly lower in subjects undertaking a comprehensive health checkup with lifestyle education. Lifestyle education at health checkup for people with prediabetes might prevent progression to diabetes by reducing modifiable risk factors.  
10777010	Alcohol, tobacco and coffee consumption and the risk of pancreatic cancer: results from the Canadian Enhanced Surveillance System case-control project. Canadian Cancer Registries Epidemiology Research Group.	European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP)	2000	test	14	6	7	Alcohol, tobacco and coffee consumption and the risk of pancreatic cancer: results from the Canadian Enhanced Surveillance System case-control project. Canadian Cancer Registries Epidemiology Research Group.  The relationship between alcohol, tobacco and coffee consumption and pancreatic cancer was investigated using population-based case-control data obtained from eight Canadian provinces. Our findings are based on analyses performed on 583 histologically confirmed pancreatic cancer cases and 4813 controls. Questionnaire data were obtained directly from 76% of the cases. Male subjects with 35 or more cigarette pack-years had an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer relative to never smokers (OR= 1.46, 95% CI 1.00-2.14). Similarly, women reporting at least 23 cigarette pack-years of smoking had an odds ratio of 1.84 (95% CI 1.25-2.69). For the most part, consumption of total alcohol, wine, liquor and beer was not associated with pancreatic cancer. Coffee drinking was not related to pancreatic cancer. More work is needed to clarify the role of these and other potentially modifiable risk factors as a means to reduce the incidence of this disease for which treatment results remain disappointing.  
19061687	Rapid resolution of delusional parasitosis in pellagra with niacin augmentation therapy.	General hospital psychiatry	2008	test	7	17	0	Rapid resolution of delusional parasitosis in pellagra with niacin augmentation therapy.  Pellagra is associated with low levels of vitamin B3 (niacin) and/or tryptophan and often involves other other B vitamins. Since the time Gasper Casal first described the disease in 1972, it was observed that the patients with pellagra were all poor, subsisted mainly on maize, and rarely ate fresh meat. Subsequent occurrences have been in the form of epidemic outbreaks, consequent to either introduction to maize as a major food or increased consumption of other niacin-deficient diets like Jowar (Sorgum vulgare). The virtual disappearance of pellagra as an endemic health problem in recent years can be attributed to a rise in the standard of living of farmers and diversification of the diet globally. The clinical picture is a combination of multisystem alterations typically involving gastrointestinal, skin and central nervous system abnormalities. The cardinal manifestations have been popularly known as the three D's, which are dementia, dermatitis and diarrhea. Psychiatric manifestations are fairly common but are easily overlooked due to their non specific nature. These are commonly seen as irritability, poor concentration, anxiety, fatigue, restlessness, apathy and depression. The occurence of psychosis in pellagra is an uncommon finding, which is usually seen in advanced stages of pellagroid encephalopathy, commonly found in chronic alcoholics. Delusional parasitosis has been also reported in this condition, although the association is still controversial. We report a case of pellagra manifesting with delusional parasitosis in a man whose delusion resolved rapidly after he started niacin-augmentation therapy. This case may provide clues to the biological underpinnings of delusional parasitosis as well as niacin treatment as treatment option in similar cases.  
25238903	[Therapeutic management of bipolar disorder in France and Europe: a multinational longitudinal study (WAVE-bd)].	L'Encephale	2014	test	2	11	0	[Therapeutic management of bipolar disorder in France and Europe: a multinational longitudinal study (WAVE-bd)].  BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder is a complex disease which requires multiple healthcare resources and complex medical care programs including pharmacological and non pharmacological treatment. If mood stabilizers remain the corner stone for bipolar disorder treatment, the development of atypical antipsychotics and their use as mood stabilizers has significantly modified therapeutic care. At the present time, psychiatrists have a large variety of psychotropic drugs for bipolar disorder: mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics... However, despite the publication of guidelines on pharmacological treatment, with a high degree of consensus, everyday clinical practices remain heterogeneous. Moreover, there are few longitudinal studies to describe therapeutic management of bipolar disorder, whatever the phase of the disease is. Indeed, most of the studies are carried out on a specific phase of the disease or treatment. And there is no study comparing French and European practices. OBJECTIVES: In this paper, we aim to present the comparison of the management of pharmacological treatments of bipolar disorder between France and Europe, using the data of the observational Wide AmbispectiVE study of the clinical management and burden of bipolar disorder (WAVE-bd study). METHODS: The WAVE-bd study is a multinational, multicentre and non-interventional cohort study of patients diagnosed with BD type I or type II, according to DSM IV-TR criteria, in any phase of the disorder, who have experienced at least one mood event during the 12 months before enrolment. In total, 2507 patients have been included across 8 countries of Europe (480 in France). Data collection was retrospective (from 3 to 12 months), but also prospective (from 9 to 15 months) for a total study length of 12 to 27 months. Main outcome measures were the healthcare resource use and pharmacological treatments. RESULTS: Our results show differences in the therapeutic management of bipolar disorder between France and other European countries. Regarding healthcare resource use, our results show that French patients consult more frequently a psychiatrist or a psychologist and less frequently a general practitioner or the emergency ward in comparison with patients from other European countries. In the whole European population, including France, atypical antipsychotics are widely used. Only 25% of the patients receive lithium and more than 50% of the patients receive antidepressants, while their use in bipolar disorder remains controversial. Most of the patients receive polymedication. Considering all phases of the disease pooled, less lithium and less atypical antipsychotics are prescribed to French patients, whereas they receive more antidepressants and more benzodiazepines than patients from other European countries. On the over hand, prescription of anticonvulsants and electroconvulsive therapy are equal. Moreover, data analyses by polarity of the episodes globally confirm these trends. There are a few exceptions: mixed states, in which lithium is twice more prescribed in France in comparison to other countries; depressive states, in which antidepressants are even more prescribed in other countries than in France; and less prescription of anticonvulsants in manic, mixed and euthymic phases in France. CONCLUSION: The WAVE-bd study is the first observational study conducted on a large sample of bipolar I and II patients that compares therapeutic management between France and other European countries. The differences observed in therapeutic care across the different phases of the disease show that treatments differ depending on the countries studied, but also according to the preventive or curative phases, polarity of the bipolar disorder, comorbidities, impact of guidelines, and care organization. Although French patients have been treated by less lithium and less atypical antipsychotics than other European patients, they receive more antidepressants and more benzodiazepines. Finally, patients generally receive polymedication and the diversity in prescriptions shows how bipolar disorder is a complex disorder.  
30045516	Outdoor air pollution, greenspace, and incidence of ADHD: A semi-individual study.	The Science of the total environment	2018	test	10	12	3	Outdoor air pollution, greenspace, and incidence of ADHD: A semi-individual study.  BACKGROUND: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a frequently occurring neurodevelopmental disorder, symptoms of which first appear in early childhood. Etiology of ADHD is not well understood. We investigated whether outdoor air pollution and greenspace affect ADHD incidence in children residing in Saxony. METHODS: 66,823 children, all beneficiaries of the statutory health insurance company AOK PLUS and born between 2000 and 2004, were followed until 2014. We considered any child with at least one ICD-10-GM F90 diagnosis by a child/adolescent psychiatrist, neuropaediatrician, or psychotherapist an ADHD case. Children's home addresses were known up to their four-digit postal code area. Population-weighted mean values of particulate matter with diameter of < 10 mum (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated for 186 postal code areas. Associations with each exposure were assessed by two-level adjusted Poisson regression models. RESULTS: 2044 children (3.06%) were diagnosed with ADHD within the observation period. An increase of PM10 and NO2 by 10 mug/m(3) raised the relative risk of ADHD by a factor of 1.97 [95% CI: 1.35-2.86] and 1.32 [1.10-1.58], respectively. A 0.1-unit increase in NDVI decreased the relative risk of ADHD by a factor of 0.82 [0.68-0.98]. Better access to child/adolescent psychiatrists was the most important confounder that increased ADHD risk across all models. CONCLUSION: Our results provide some evidence that air pollution might affect ADHD. Future studies with more detailed address information and better control for confounders, in particular socioeconomic status and parental psychopathology, should replicate the observed associations.  
31617322	What do health providers and patients tweet about schizophrenia?	Early intervention in psychiatry	2020	test	2	4	0	What do health providers and patients tweet about schizophrenia?  AIM: Twitter is the most commonly used social media forum in public health and is considered the radio of the internet. Many health providers utilize this media to disseminate health information. Patient use of social media for mental health topics encourages providers to disseminate quality information and to develop virtual collaborative learning environments. This study explored trends in health information exchanged by patients, doctors and health organizations about schizophrenia through analyses of tweets posted using the #schizophrenia. METHODS: The likelihood that the information distributed by each user type was scholarly was assessed via qualitative and logistic regression analyses. Specifically, a sequential exploratory multimethod of data analysis guided this study with a sample of 981 tweets. RESULTS: Most tweets focused on the improvement of schizophrenia literacy (n = 366) followed by personal experiences/motivational stories (n = 207) and biological explanations of the disorder (n = 158). Logistic regression results indicated that compared to doctors, patients were less likely to tweet with a scholarly source (OR = 0.481, CI = 0.311, .744; P < .001). All users were less likely to include a scholarly source when tweeting about schizophrenia literacy, personal/motivational experiences, campaign/organizational events or illness management in comparison to those who tweeted about biological explanations of schizophrenia. CONCLUSION: Results suggest all users disseminated beneficial information that can increase public schizophrenia literacy and illness management, while connecting individuals to organizational events targeting this debilitating disorder. Health providers are encouraged to establish a presence on social media to share scholarly work with patients and promote prompt treatment for schizophrenia.  
32987320	Effects of vitamin D on mood and sleep in the healthy population: Interpretations from the serotonergic pathway.	Sleep medicine reviews	2021	test	13	0	0	Effects of vitamin D on mood and sleep in the healthy population: Interpretations from the serotonergic pathway.  Vitamin D insufficiency is common in the healthy population. Recent insights addressed the role of vitamin D in serotonin and melatonin regulation, suggesting that increasing vitamin D status may be helpful for improving mood and sleep. This literature review covers the current state of evidence regarding potential effects of vitamin D on mood and sleep indicators in healthy people. In total, 11 observational studies were found for sleep, and 54 studies on mood (including ten RCTs). These studies revealed mixed results for both sleep and mood. The findings were interpreted based on the previously proposed serotonergic pathway of vitamin D. Implications and challenges for future research regarding the timing of blood sampling, timing and dosage of supplement intake and investigating the response dynamics are discussed.
