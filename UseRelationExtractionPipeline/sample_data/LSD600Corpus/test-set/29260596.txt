Transverse myelitis following methotrexate treatment of ectopic pregnancy: a case report. 
OBJECTIVE: Ectopic pregnancy is a common condition in the field of gynaecology, often treated with methotrexate. Adverse effects are common and usually mild. Severe adverse events are rare amongst patients treated with MTX for this condition. CASE: A 26-year-old healthy woman was admitted and treated medically with MTX for an ectopic pregnancy. The patient was treated in the standard drug labelled protocol with an intramuscular injection of 78 mg of MTX according to body surface area. Soon after, the patient presented to the emergency department with symptoms of bilateral paresthesia of the lower limbs which ascended to the pelvis. After a thorough work up and imaging via MRI a diagnosis of transverse myelitis was made. Treatment was successful with corticosteroids and symptoms subsided. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that MTX should be used with caution and severe toxicity should be kept in mind with high index of awareness for any symptom development following treatment, especially neurological one.
