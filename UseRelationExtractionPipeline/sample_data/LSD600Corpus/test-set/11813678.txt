Establishing community partnerships: providing better oral health care to underserved children. 
A community partnership between a dental hygiene school and a social service program was designed to improve oral health outcomes and reduce disparities among children. This resulted in a preventive oral hygiene care project that complimented the dental hygiene program's didactic curriculum. The children received much needed oral health care and education, while the experiences enhanced dental hygiene student learning by applying the principles for planning, implementing, and evaluating dental health programs; establishing a context for understanding the prevalence of oral disease as well the disparity among population subsets; and developing a variety of clinical skills. Oral health professionals and dental hygiene programs may find this partnership a prototype of a highly productive and beneficial community health experience that could be incorporated, in part or in it's entirety, into their own community health projects.
