Risk factors for childhood obesity in a Greek paediatric population. 
OBJECTIVE: Obesity in children is a serious public health issue in Greece. The purpose of the current study was to identify risk factors such as birth weight, breast-feeding, dietary patterns, family history of obesity and sedentary behaviours that are possibly associated with paediatric obesity. DESIGN: Two hundred and five overweight and obese children (OW/OB; group 1) aged 7-15 years from eight primary and secondary schools and a control group (group 2) of normal-weight children were matched for age and sex. Overweight and obesity were calculated based on the International Obesity Taskforce criteria. Lifestyle parameters as well as anthropometric data were collected in all children. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for obesity. RESULTS: Breast-feeding (> or =3 months) and leisure-time physical activity proved to be protector factors against obesity (OR = 0.21, 95 % CI 0.11, 0.79, P < 0.001 and OR = 0.87, 95 % CI 0.85, 0.89, P < 0.001 respectively). On the other hand, family history of obesity (OR = 3.79, 95 % CI 2.61, 4.18, P < 0.001), sugar-sweetened beverage consumption (OR = 1.77, 95 % CI 1.03, 2.76, P < 0.001) and watching television (OR = 1.99, 95 % CI 1.54, 2.76, P = 0.04) were found to be positively associated with a higher obesity risk. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings support the literature according to which duration of breast-feeding (<3 months), a family history of obesity, watching television, sedentary lifestyle and consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages are important risk factors for childhood obesity. More studies are needed to elucidate the relationship of paediatric obesity and possible predictor factors in order to avoid health consequences in these children later on in life.
