Treating problem gamblers: working towards empirically supported treatment. 
There is an urgent need for mental health professionals to develop effective treatments for pathological gambling. A scientific meeting was held in Quebec City in June 2002 where 13 specialists in the treatment of gamblers pursued the objectives of making the "State of the art" statement concerning the procedures and the methodology to be used in future treatment outcome studies. This paper introduces this special issue of the Journal of Gambling Studies and identifies some of the key issues that confront clinicians and researchers interested in evidence based treatment for gambling related disorders.
