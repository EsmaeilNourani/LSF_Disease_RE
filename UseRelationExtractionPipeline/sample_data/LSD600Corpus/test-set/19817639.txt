Effects of Manisa propolis on telomerase activity in leukemia cells obtained from the bone marrow of leukemia patients. 
Propolis is a resinous material collected by honeybees and obtained from beehives that has anticancer effects by inducing apoptosis. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of propolis on human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) in the leukemia cells obtained from leukemia patients. Four different bone marrow cell cultures from each of four leukemia cases were prepared. The 60 ng/ml, 30 ng/ml and 15 ng/ml working concentrations of propolis were administered to three cultures of each patient, while one culture contained only culture medium. hTERT mRNA expression levels of cells were detected at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h using the LightCycler 2.0 instrument. A significant decrease in hTERT expression levels was observed in the 60 ng/ml concentration of propolis. In conclusion, Manisa propolis may also have a potential effect on the expression of hTERT in leukemia-particularly owing to its constituent chrysin.
