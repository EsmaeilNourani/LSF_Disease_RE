Orthodontic and orthognathic management of a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta and dentinogenesis imperfecta: a case report. 
This case report describes a patient's severe Class III malocclusion, managed with a combination of orthodontic and orthognathic treatment. The medical history was complicated by osteogenesis imperfecta and dentinogenesis imperfecta. In addition the patient was a Jehovah's Witness. Patients with osteogenesis imperfecta carry an increased risk of perioperative haemorrhage, and this led to bimaxillary surgery being carried out as two discrete surgical episodes for the patient described. In addition, the risk of enamel fracture led to orthodontic bands being cemented on all teeth. In spite of the increased risks a successful outcome was achieved.
