The role of fluoride in the preventive management of dentin hypersensitivity and root caries. 
OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to bring light on fluoride to control dentin hypersensitivity (DHS) and prevent root caries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Search strategy included papers mainly published in PubMed, Medline from October 2000 to October 2011. RESULTS: Fluoride toothpaste shows a fair effect on sensitive teeth when combined with dentin fluid-obstructing agents such as different metal ions, potassium, and oxalates. Fluoride in solution, gel, and varnish give an instant and long-term relief of dentin and bleaching hypersensitivity. Combined with laser technology, a limited additional positive effect is achieved. Prevention of root caries is favored by toothpaste with 5,000 ppm F and by fluoride rinsing with 0.025-0.1 % F solutions, as the application of fluoride gel or fluoride varnish three to four times a year. Fluoride measures with tablets, chewing gum, toothpick, and flossing may be questioned because of unfavorable cost effectiveness ratio. CONCLUSION: Most fluoride preparations in combination with dentin fluid obstruction agents are beneficial to reduce DHS. Prevention of root caries is favorable with higher fluoride concentrations in, e.g., toothpaste. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Fluoride is an effective agent to control DHS and to prevent root caries particularly when used in higher concentrations.
