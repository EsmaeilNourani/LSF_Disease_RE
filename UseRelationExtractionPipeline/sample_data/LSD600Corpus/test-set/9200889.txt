Orthodontic treatment and temporomandibular disorder: is there a relationship? Part 2: Clinical implications. 
Although a review of the current literature does not reveal compelling evidence for the claim that orthodontic treatment prevents, causes, or cures temporomandibular disorders (TMD), the currently available clinical studies devoted to this topic share some methodological weaknesses, some of which are discussed in the present article. Another purpose of this paper is to extend the current understanding about the relationship between orthodontics and TMD to situations occurring in routine clinical practice. By doing so, we provide suggestions that are intended to help the orthodontist in decision-making when he or she deals with a patient who is in need of orthodontic treatment for dental or skeletal reasons, but has a history of TMD, or who develops TMD signs and symptoms during or after treatment.
