Monitoring of the benzene and toluene contents in human milk. 
Twenty-three samples of human milk collected from the milk bank of a children's hospital were analysed with a view to monitoring the possible presence of some of the most common aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene and toluene) and to quantify their concentrations. The analysis was carried out by the "purge and trap" technique combined with gas chromatography and with the use of the mass spectrometer as detector. The hydrocarbons themselves were used in a deuterated form as internal standards. The analysis of the data showed the presence of both hydrocarbons, even though their quantity was much lower than that detected in other foods.
