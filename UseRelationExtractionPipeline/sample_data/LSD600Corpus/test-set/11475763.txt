Automated oral hygiene self-care devices: making evidence-based choices to improve client outcomes. 
Dental hygienists have historically been the primary promoters of health, prevention, and wellness in dental practice. With the large number of automated self-care devices available, many clients expect their dental hygienists to be experts and advisors on such purchases. It is vitally important for dental hygienists to understand and evaluate the available clinical research findings, and along with their clients, apply them in a collaborative decision making process. The purpose of this course is for dental hygienists to learn the scientific and practical implications of evidence-based care in the selection of automated oral hygiene self-care devices. Measurable clinical outcomes in plaque removal, reduction in gingivitis, bleeding, probing depth, periodontal pathogens, and the role of inflammatory mediators will be discussed. Automated self-care products currently available will be identified. Successful completion of the course objectives will be assessed by a post-test, to be completed by the learner after reading the article in its entirety. Two hours of continuing education course credit will be awarded following successful completion of the post test.
