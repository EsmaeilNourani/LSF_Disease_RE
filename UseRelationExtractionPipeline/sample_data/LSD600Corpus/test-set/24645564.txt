[Long term regular physical activity as a factor modifying the incidence of subclinical atherosclerosis in occupationally active men]. 
BACKGROUND: Optimal dose of physical activity in the prevention of atherosclerosis remains unclear. The purpose of the study was to investigate the influence of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) on selected indices of atherosclerosis in the working-age population of men. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out in a cohort of asymptomatic men participating in follow-up examinations in the Healthy Men Clinic, Medical University of Lodz. Of the 132 men who responded to the invitation to participate in this study, 101 men were eligible for the non-invasive assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis indices. Self-reported PA was assessed by interviewer-administered validated questionnaires. During the latest follow-up subclinical atherosclerosis was measured by assessing the coronary artery calcification (CAC), the carotid inti ma-media thickness (IMT) and the reactive hyperemia index (RHI) using peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT2000). RESULTS: Preliminary results have been elaborated in the group of 60 men (mean age: 61.3 +/- 8.85 years). The participants were predominantly white collar workers with low occupational LTPA. The cohort was divided into 3 groups according to the LTPA level. Both dose and energy expenditure of recreational PA significantly correlated with CA, IMT and RHI in the whole cohort. The majority of men maintained their baseline PA throughout the observation period. Men with the highest LTPA level had significantly lower mean CAC, IMT (p < 0.01), and significantly higher mean RHI (p < 0.05) compared to the least active group. On final examination men with high PA had also the most favorable cardiovascular profile. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results indicate the protective effect of high LTPA level in the context of subclinical atherosclerosis in men.
