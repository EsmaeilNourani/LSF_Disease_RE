Clinical photographs--the gold standard. 
This survey was carried out to allow a minimum data set required for intra- and extra-oral photographs to be established. In 1999 a questionnaire was sent to members of the Angle Society of Europe to establish their current clinical practice with regard to extra- and intra-oral photography. The Angle Society was chosen because of their stated commitment to a high standard of record keeping and of clinical care. Results showed that a full series of extra- and intra-oral photographs were taken both before and after treatment, as well as stage photographs during treatment on many cases. The need for each of these photographs will be discussed in some detail, and recommendations will be made as to what would be considered the Gold standard before, during, and after a course of orthodontic treatment.
