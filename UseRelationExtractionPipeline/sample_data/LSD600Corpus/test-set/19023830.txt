The impact of the 2006 Scottish smoke-free legislation on sales of nicotine replacement therapy. 
This study used over-the-counter (OTC) sales of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to investigate the impact of the introduction of smoke-free legislation in Scotland in March 2006 on smoking cessation behaviour. The time series of NRT sales (units and value) in Scotland from 2004 to 2006 were compared with the same period for the rest of the UK, and analysed using an ARIMA time series model. There was a significant increase in units and value of NRT sales in Scotland in the first 6 months of 2006 (p< or =0.001), apparent from January and prior to the introduction of the smoking ban, with no comparable increase for the rest of the UK. There was no significant increase in NRT sales for the second half of 2006. These data suggest an increase in smoking cessation behaviour in the period immediately before the introduction of smoke-free legislation, but this was not sustained beyond the first few months of the post-legislation period.
