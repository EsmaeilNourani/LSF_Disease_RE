[Prevalence and risk factors of hypertension among residents of 30 years or above years old in Pengzhou city of Sichuan province]. 
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of hypertension among residents in Pengzhou city of Sichuan province. METHODS: Among 20 townships in Pengzhou city of Sichuan Province, 14 townships were selected using a clustered sampling based on the economic level and distance. The registered residents in the selected townships aged 30-79 years were recruited for a comprehensive survey from 2004 to 2007. A total of 55 687 residents (21 315 males and 34 372 females) were selected based on a face to face questionnaire interview and physical examination; the patient group included 14 151 residents with hypertension and the control group had 41 536 residents without hypertension were selected. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to investigate the influence factors for hypertension. OR (95%CI) values were calculated. Different levels of risk exposure factors were transformed into the risk scores using a statistical model. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of hypertension was 25.41% among residents aged 30 years or above in Pengzhou (14 151/55 687), 28.95% (6 170/21 315) for male residents and 23.22% (7 981/34 372) for female residents. Multivaraite logistic regression analysis showed that main risk factors for hypertension in male residents were age, low educational level, widower, low household income, no medical insurance, no fresh fruits intake, high body mass index (BMI), high waist to hip ratio, and low physical activity, which was less than 3 metabolic equivalent of task (MET) level, among which the highest three riskswere (not including the social demographic characteristics) BMI>=28 kg/m(2), waist to hip ratio >=0.90, and not consuming fresh fruits. OR (95% CI) values for these three key factors were 3.74 (3.27-4.28), 1.34 (1.24-1.44), and 1.27 (1.14-1.41), respectively. The corresponding risk scores for these factors were 2.993, 1.102, and 1.237, respectively. Main risk factors for hypertension in female residents were age, working hours, no medical insurance, fewer number of family members, no fresh fruits intake, smoking, never drinking tea, no dairy products intake, high BMI, highwaist to hip ratio and low physical activity, among which the highest three risks were (not including the social demographic characteristics) BMI >=28 kg/m(2), MET level, and waist to hip ratio >=0.85. OR (95% CI) values for these three key factors were 3.30 (3.02-3.60), 1.35 (1.22-1.51), and 1.33 (1.23-1.44), respectively. The corresponding risk scores for these factors were 2.390, 1.263, and 1.051, respectively. CONCLUSION: The prevalence rate of hypertension among the residents over 30 years of age in Pengzhou city was 25.41%. The main risk factors were age, not consuming fresh fruits, high BMI, high waist to hip ratio, and low MET level.
