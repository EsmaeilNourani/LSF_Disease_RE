Absorption of color additives and settling volume in water of blue-green alga, ishikurage (Nostoc commune). 
The properties of ishikurage (Nostoc commune) and other algae were compared. Ishikurage and suizenji nori (Aphanothece sacrum) absorbed much more amaranth than others. They have a high settling volume (SV) in water. The high SV of ishikurage is attributable to its neutral detergent fiber (NDF). The acid detergent fiber (ADF) from the alga had a high amaranth absorption. However the absorption by the ADF did not explain the absorption by ishikurage. The results suggest that ishikurage may have a nutritional significance as a source of dietary fiber.
