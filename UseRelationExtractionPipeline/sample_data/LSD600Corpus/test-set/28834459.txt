An Exploratory Analysis of Adherence Patterns and Program Completion of a Pedometer-Based Physical Activity Intervention. 
BACKGROUND: We examined participant characteristics related to pedometer program adherence and completion. METHODS: Participants (n = 177, age = 43 +/- 9 y, BMI = 29.5 +/- 6.2 kg/m(2)) were from sedentary workplaces. Baseline steps/day for women (n = 153) was 7230 +/- 3447 versus men (n = 24) 8265 +/- 2849 (P < 0.05). Records included pedometer use, days/week goals were achieved, and steps/day. Program completers (n = 104) fulfilled pre- and post-program assessments and at least 8 wk of recording. Non-completers (n = 53) met neither requirement, but pre-program data were available. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in sex, age, education, or time at work between completion strata. The only significant baseline difference was an initial "worry about completing the program" (completer < non-completer; P < 0.05). The pedometer-based program was most successful in increasing physical activity in overweight or class I obese individuals. Participants with lower baseline steps/day were also more likely to complete the program. CONCLUSION: The study findings have potential to inform effective health promotion planning.
