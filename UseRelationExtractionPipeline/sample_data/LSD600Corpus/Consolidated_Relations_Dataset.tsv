pathological gambling	alcohol addicts	positive_statistical_association	30267528	train	T13	T25	1630:1651	1658:1673	"Prevalence of Pathological Gambling among Alcohol Addicts in Outpatient Treatment in the City of Zagreb: a Cross-Sectional Study. 
BACKGROUND: Various types of addictions often co-occur, particularly substance and behavioral ones, which affects the clinical course of mental health disorders as well as the efficacy of therapy and rehabilitation efforts. The present study aims to explore gambling activities and possible gambling addiction among alcoholics in an outpatient treatment in the city of Zagreb. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Gambling activities were assessed in 140 members of alcohol addiction clubs in the City of Zagreb (Croatia). Participants were undergoing treatment after being diagnosed by their psychiatrist with alcohol dependence syndrome based on ICD-10 criteria. Intensity of gambling-related problems was measured using the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), while intensity of alcohol addiction was assessed using DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder. All instruments were self-report forms and were completed using pen and paper in a group context during outpatient treatment. RESULTS: Pathological gambling was more prevalent in this clinical subsample than in general populations analysed in other studies. Alcohol addicts showing problematic or pathological gambling behaviors tended to play more highly addictive games (sports betting, slot machines, roulette). However, intensity of gambling-related problems did not correlate significantly with the intensity of alcohol addiction. CONCLUSION: These results confirm studies from other countries showing higher prevalence of problematic and pathological gambling among alcohol addicts than in the general population. Gambling behavior in our sample more often involved games with greater addictive potential. These findings suggest that alcohol addicts should be systematically screened for problematic and pathological gambling, which may improve therapeutic efficacy and rehabilitation, as well as reduce relapse in addictive behavior in general."

rhabdomyolysis	Prolonged exercise	Causes	27399985	train	T24	T22	826:840	751:769	"Substrate kinetics in patients with disorders of skeletal muscle metabolism. 
The main purpose of the following studies was to investigate pathophysiological mechanisms in fat and carbohydrate metabolism and effect of nutritional interventions in patients with metabolic myopathies and in patients with severe muscle wasting. Yet there is no cure for patients with skeletal muscle disorders. The group of patients is heterozygous and this thesis is focused on patients with metabolic myopathies and low muscle mass due to severe muscle wasting. Disorders of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) are, along with myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease), the most common inborn errors of metabolism leading to recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis in adults. Prolonged exercise, fasting, and fever are the main triggering factors for rhabdomyolysis in these conditions, and can be complicated by acute renal failure. Patients with low muscle mass are in risk of loosing their functional skills and depend on a wheel chair and respiratory support. We used nutritional interventions and metabolic studies with stable isotope technique and indirect calorimetry in patients with metabolic myopathies and patients with low muscle mass to get information of the metabolism of the investigated diseases, and to gain knowledge of the biochemical pathways of intermediary metabolism in human skeletal muscle. We have shown that patients with fat metabolism disorders in skeletal muscle affecting the transporting enzyme of fat into the mitochondria (carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency) and affecting the enzyme responsible for breakdown of the long-chain fatty acids (very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) have a normal fatty acid oxidation at rest, but enzyme activity is too low to increase fatty acid oxidation during exercise. Furthermore, these patients benefit from a carbohydrate rich diet. Oppositely is exercise capacity worsened by a fat-rich diet in these patients. The patients also benefit from IV glucose, however, when glucose is given orally just before exercise, exercise capacity is worsened, most likely due to the sympatho-adrenergt response, that increases heart rate and blocks gluconeogenesis. Substrate turnover studies in patients with McArdle disease and phosphorylase b kinase deficiency showed that palmitate lipolysis, utilization and plasma concentration was higher and total CHO lower in the patients during exercise vs. healthy subjects. In patients with low muscle mass glucose homeostasis is impaired, and our findings showed that these patients are prone to develop hypoglycaemia during prolonged fasting. The following studies emphasize the importance of skeletal muscle in production of energy, both when skeletal muscle lack important metabolic enzymes (metabolic myopathies), and when skeletal muscle mass is low."

colon cancer	physical activity	negative_statistical_association	22562221	train	T3	T18	141:153	115:132	"Resistance training and the risk of colon and rectal cancers. 
PURPOSE: Although there is convincing evidence that physical activity reduces colon cancer risk, research in this area has focused on aerobic activity. We conducted a case-control study to investigate whether resistance training was associated with the risk of colon and rectal cancers. METHODS: Data were collected on various colorectal cancer risk factors, including recreational physical activity performed during three age periods, from 870 cases and 996 controls in Western Australia in 2005-2007. Participants were classified as having never, possibly, or definitely performed resistance training in each age period and over the adult lifetime. The association between resistance training and colon and rectal cancer risk was analyzed using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Participants who definitely performed resistance training in their lifetime had a non-significant reduced risk of colon cancer compared with those who did no resistance training (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.70, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.45-1.11). No association was found for rectal cancer risk (AOR = 1.16, 95 % CI = 0.71-1.87). Performing resistance training was associated with a lower risk of colon cancer in each age period, although none of the relationships were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This study provides some initial evidence, albeit inconclusive, that resistance training may be inversely associated with colon cancer risk."

Recent clinical trials have explored the effects of statins on CVD specifically in CKD patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Whereas the risk relationship between total cholesterol level and CVD morbidity and mortality is direct, strong and progressive in CKD patients without malnutrition and inflammation, it is inconsistent and often paradoxical in those with malnutrition and inflammation. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that statins reduce significantly the risk of CVD in CKD patients before the initiation of dialysis. However, the beneficial effect of statins in CKD patients on dialysis is uncertain. In CKD patients on dialysis, malnutrition and inflammation pose a higher risk for CVD than dyslipidemia.

neural tube defects	secondhand smoke	Statistically_associated	27443814	train	T3	T2	215:234	149:165	"Associations between maternal periconceptional exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke and major birth defects. 
BACKGROUND: While associations between secondhand smoke and a few birth defects (namely, oral clefts and neural tube defects) have been noted in the scientific literature, to our knowledge, there is no single or comprehensive source of population-based information on its associations with a range of birth defects among nonsmoking mothers. OBJECTIVE: We utilized data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, a large population-based multisite case-control study, to examine associations between maternal reports of periconceptional exposure to secondhand smoke in the household or workplace/school and major birth defects. STUDY DESIGN: The multisite National Birth Defects Prevention Study is the largest case-control study of birth defects to date in the United States. We selected cases from birth defect groups having >100 total cases, as well as all nonmalformed controls (10,200), from delivery years 1997 through 2009; 44 birth defects were examined. After excluding cases and controls from multiple births and whose mothers reported active smoking or pregestational diabetes, we analyzed data on periconceptional secondhand smoke exposure-encompassing the period 1 month prior to conception through the first trimester. For the birth defect craniosynostosis, we additionally examined the effect of exposure in the second and third trimesters as well due to the potential sensitivity to teratogens for this defect throughout pregnancy. Covariates included in all final models of birth defects with >=5 exposed mothers were study site, previous live births, time between estimated date of delivery and interview date, maternal age at estimated date of delivery, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, nativity, household income divided by number of people supported by this income, periconceptional alcohol consumption, and folic acid supplementation. For each birth defect examined, we used logistic regression analyses to estimate both crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for both isolated and total case groups for various sources of exposure (household only; workplace/school only; household and workplace/school; household or workplace/school). RESULTS: The prevalence of secondhand smoke exposure only across all sources ranged from 12.9-27.8% for cases and 14.5-15.8% for controls. The adjusted odds ratios for any vs no secondhand smoke exposure in the household or workplace/school and isolated birth defects were significantly elevated for neural tube defects (anencephaly: adjusted odds ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-2.25; and spina bifida: adjusted odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.86); orofacial clefts (cleft lip without cleft palate: adjusted odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.81; cleft lip with or without cleft palate: adjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.46; cleft palate alone: adjusted odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.63); bilateral renal agenesis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-3.75); amniotic band syndrome-limb body wall complex (adjusted odds ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.51); and atrial septal defects, secundum (adjusted odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.72). There were no significant inverse associations observed. CONCLUSION: Additional studies replicating the findings are needed to better understand the moderate positive associations observed between periconceptional secondhand smoke and several birth defects in this analysis. Increased odds ratios resulting from chance (eg, multiple comparisons) or recall bias cannot be ruled out."

We selected cases from birth defect groups having >100 total cases, as well as all nonmalformed controls (10,200), from delivery years 1997 through 2009; 44 birth defects were examined. After excluding cases and controls from multiple births and whose mothers reported active smoking or pregestational diabetes, we analyzed data on periconceptional secondhand smoke exposure-encompassing the period 1 month prior to conception through the first trimester. For the birth defect craniosynostosis, we additionally examined the effect of exposure in the second and third trimesters as well due to the potential sensitivity to teratogens for this defect throughout pregnancy. Covariates included in all final models of birth defects with >=5 exposed mothers were study site, previous live births, time between estimated date of delivery and interview date, maternal age at estimated date of delivery, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, nativity, household income divided by number of people supported by this income, periconceptional alcohol consumption, and folic acid supplementation. For each birth defect examined, we used logistic regression analyses to estimate both crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for both isolated and total case groups for various sources of exposure (household only; workplace/school only; household and workplace/school; household or workplace/school). RESULTS: The prevalence of secondhand smoke exposure only across all sources ranged from 12.9-27.8% for cases and 14.5-15.8% for controls. The adjusted odds ratios for any vs no secondhand smoke exposure in the household or workplace/school and isolated birth defects were significantly elevated for neural tube defects (anencephaly: adjusted odds ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-2.25; and spina bifida: adjusted odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.86); orofacial clefts (cleft lip without cleft palate: adjusted odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.81; cleft lip with or without cleft palate: adjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.46; cleft palate alone: adjusted odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.63); bilateral renal agenesis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-3.75); amniotic band syndrome-limb body wall complex (adjusted odds ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.51); and atrial septal defects, secundum (adjusted odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.72). There were no significant inverse associations observed. CONCLUSION: Additional studies replicating the findings are needed to better understand the moderate positive associations observed between periconceptional secondhand smoke and several birth defects in this analysis. Increased odds ratios resulting from chance (eg, multiple comparisons) or recall bias cannot be ruled out."

The adjusted odds ratios for any vs no secondhand smoke exposure in the household or workplace/school and isolated birth defects were significantly elevated for neural tube defects (anencephaly: adjusted odds ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-2.25; and spina bifida: adjusted odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.86); orofacial clefts (cleft lip without cleft palate: adjusted odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.81; cleft lip with or without cleft palate: adjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.46; cleft palate alone: adjusted odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.63); bilateral renal agenesis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-3.75); amniotic band syndrome-limb body wall complex (adjusted odds ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.51); and atrial septal defects, secundum (adjusted odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.72).

BACKGROUND: While associations between secondhand smoke and a few birth defects (namely, oral clefts and neural tube defects) have been noted in the scientific literature, to our knowledge, there is no single or comprehensive source of population-based information on its associations with a range of birth defects among nonsmoking mothers. OBJECTIVE: We utilized data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, a large population-based multisite case-control study, to examine associations between maternal reports of periconceptional exposure to secondhand smoke in the household or workplace/school and major birth defects. STUDY DESIGN: The multisite National Birth Defects Prevention Study is the largest case-control study of birth defects to date in the United States. We selected cases from birth defect groups having >100 total cases, as well as all nonmalformed controls (10,200), from delivery years 1997 through 2009; 44 birth defects were examined. After excluding cases and controls from multiple births and whose mothers reported active smoking or pregestational diabetes, we analyzed data on periconceptional secondhand smoke exposure-encompassing the period 1 month prior to conception through the first trimester. For the birth defect craniosynostosis, we additionally examined the effect of exposure in the second and third trimesters as well due to the potential sensitivity to teratogens for this defect throughout pregnancy. Covariates included in all final models of birth defects with >=5 exposed mothers were study site, previous live births, time between estimated date of delivery and interview date, maternal age at estimated date of delivery, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, nativity, household income divided by number of people supported by this income, periconceptional alcohol consumption, and folic acid supplementation. For each birth defect examined, we used logistic regression analyses to estimate both crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for both isolated and total case groups for various sources of exposure (household only; workplace/school only; household and workplace/school; household or workplace/school).

Although epidemiological evidence on the role of active cigarette smoking in breast cancer risk has been inconsistent, recent literature supports a modest association between smoking and breast cancer. This association is particularly observed in women who smoke for a long duration, or who smoke for a long time prior to their first pregnancy. Here, we provide updated results on cigarette smoking and breast cancer risk in the Canadian National Breast Screening Study (NBSS). The NBSS is a large cohort of 89,835 women, aged 40-59, who were followed for a mean of 22.1 years, resulting in the ascertainment of 6,549 incident cases of breast cancer. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of cigarette smoking variables with breast cancer risk. We found breast cancer to be associated with duration (40 years vs. 0: HR = 1.57; 95%CI = 1.29-1.92), intensity (40 cigarettes per day vs. 0: HR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.04-1.40), cumulative exposure (40 pack-years vs. 0: HR = 1.19; 95%CI = 1.06-1.13) and latency (40 years since initiation vs. 0: HR = 1.19; 95%CI = 1.10-1.53) of cigarette smoking. Number of years smoked prior to first full-term pregnancy was associated with higher risk of breast cancer than comparative years smoked post-pregnancy (among parous women, 5 years pre pregnancy vs. 0: HR = 1.18; 95%CI = 1.10-1.26). These results strongly support a role for cigarette smoking in breast cancer etiology and emphasize the importance of timing of this exposure."

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has affected nearly 28 million people in the United States and has caused more than five hundred thousand deaths as of February 21, 2021. As the novel coronavirus continues to take its toll in the United States and all across the globe, particularly among the elderly (>65 years), clinicians and translational researchers are taking a closer look at the nexus of sleep, circadian rhythms and immunity that may contribute toward a more severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2-induced multi-organ failure affects both central and peripheral organs, causing increased mortality in the elderly. However, whether differences in sleep, circadian rhythms, and immunity between older and younger individuals contribute to the age-related differences in systemic dysregulation of target organs observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection remain largely unknown. Current literature demonstrates the emerging role of sleep, circadian rhythms, and immunity in the development of chronic pulmonary diseases and respiratory infections in human and mouse models. The exact mechanism underlying acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other cardiopulmonary complications in elderly patients in combination with associated comorbidities remain unclear. Nevertheless, understanding the critical role of sleep, circadian clock dysfunction in target organs, and immune status of patients with SARS-CoV-2 may provide novel insights into possible therapies. Chronotherapy is an emerging concept that is gaining attention in sleep medicine. Accumulating evidence suggests that nearly half of all physiological functions follow a strict daily rhythm. However, healthcare professionals rarely take implementing timed-administration of drugs into consideration. In this review, we summarize recent findings directly relating to the contributing roles of sleep, circadian rhythms and immune response in modulating infectious disease processes, and integrate chronotherapy in the discussion of the potential drugs that can be repurposed to improve the treatment and management of COVID-19."

A population-based case comparison study of incident lung cancer and occupational risk factors was conducted in the tricounty Detroit metropolitan area. Nearly 6000 lung cancer cases and a comparison group of 3600 colon cancer cases were interviewed. This report includes 3792 white and black male lung cancer cases and 1966 black and white colon cancer referents. Cigarette smoking, age at diagnosis, and lifetime work history were assessed to determine the relationship between length of employment in specific occupations and industries and lung cancer. Diverse patterns of association between work history and lung cancer were observed for black and white men. Significant associations were seen between lung cancer and increasing length of employment in the following occupations: for white men, concrete and terrazzo finishers, grinding machine operators, heat treating machine operators, miscellaneous machine operators, truck drivers, driver sales, and laborers; for black men, farm workers, automobile mechanics, painting machine operators, furnace operators, and garbage collectors; for both black and white men, farmers, slicing and cutting machine operators, and garbage collectors. Distinct patterns for black and white men also were observed for length of employment by industry. This study clearly demonstrates the need to include black men in studies of occupational cancer etiology and to evaluate black and white men separately. It also indicates the necessity for cigarette smoking history to accurately assess workplace cancer risks. We propose guidelines for incorporating the use of biomarkers into further studies of occupational cancer epidemiology."

Nearly 6000 lung cancer cases and a comparison group of 3600 colon cancer cases were interviewed. This report includes 3792 white and black male lung cancer cases and 1966 black and white colon cancer referents. Cigarette smoking, age at diagnosis, and lifetime work history were assessed to determine the relationship between length of employment in specific occupations and industries and lung cancer. Diverse patterns of association between work history and lung cancer were observed for black and white men. Significant associations were seen between lung cancer and increasing length of employment in the following occupations: for white men, concrete and terrazzo finishers, grinding machine operators, heat treating machine operators, miscellaneous machine operators, truck drivers, driver sales, and laborers; for black men, farm workers, automobile mechanics, painting machine operators, furnace operators, and garbage collectors; for both black and white men, farmers, slicing and cutting machine operators, and garbage collectors. Distinct patterns for black and white men also were observed for length of employment by industry. This study clearly demonstrates the need to include black men in studies of occupational cancer etiology and to evaluate black and white men separately. It also indicates the necessity for cigarette smoking history to accurately assess workplace cancer risks. We propose guidelines for incorporating the use of biomarkers into further studies of occupational cancer epidemiology."

BACKGROUND: The world of work is continually changing, and this could result in new and emerging risks being introduced, including those that may cause work-related respiratory diseases (WRRD). AIMS: To describe recently emerging and new cases of WRRD and the relevant methodology using data in a national occupational respiratory disease surveillance scheme in the UK. METHODS: Incident cases of respiratory diseases reported by physicians to the Surveillance of Work-related and Occupational Respiratory Disease (SWORD) between January 2015 and December 2017 were included. Potentially emerging respiratory hazards manifesting in SWORD data were identified with the following hierarchical approach: (i) new respiratory disease not previously associated with work, (ii) specific exposure/agent not previously associated with WRRD and (iii) industry and/or occupation not previously associated with WRRD. RESULTS: A total of 1215 cases of WRRD were reported to SWORD between January 2015 and December 2017. No new WRRD were identified. Thirteen potentially emerging causes of occupational asthma were identified, including exposures to agents such as ninhydrin. Four potential new causes were identified for interstitial pneumonia, which included wood and brass dust. Two potentially emerging causes of WRRD were identified for inhalational accidents (green coffee and nitrocellulose), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (diphenylmethane diisocyanate and salami mould), rhinitis (morphine and Amaranthus quitensis) and sarcoidosis (prions and horses). CONCLUSIONS: Continuous monitoring and reporting of any new work-related disease is a critical function of any occupational disease reporting scheme. Potential emerging causes of work-related health risks have been identified by using a simple and systematic way of detecting emerging causes of WRRDs."

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of sleep characteristics with prevalent hypertension, diabetes, and obesity in a multiethnic cohort. DESIGN: This study used a population-based cross-sectional study design. SETTING: Participants were recruited between 2009 and 2011 from Chicago, Illinois, and the surrounding suburbs. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 492 adults aged 35 to 64years who self-reported as white, black, Hispanic, or Asian and who had a low likelihood of sleep apnea based on the apnea screening questionnaires and 1 night of apnea screening using an in-home device (apnea hypopnea index <15 or oxygen desaturation index <10). MEASUREMENTS: Participants wore a wrist actigraphy monitor (Actiwatch(TM)) for 7days. During a clinical examination, participants completed questionnaires about sleep, other health behaviors, and medical history and had their blood pressure, anthropometric measures, and fasting blood glucose measured; metabolic risk factors were determined based on standard clinical guidelines. RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension, obesity, and diabetes was 17.1%, 5.5%, and 35.4%, respectively. Sleep duration was not associated with any cardiovascular risk factor. There was a significantly increased odds for hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.08) and obesity (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05) associated with higher sleep fragmentation (per 1%).

PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 492 adults aged 35 to 64years who self-reported as white, black, Hispanic, or Asian and who had a low likelihood of sleep apnea based on the apnea screening questionnaires and 1 night of apnea screening using an in-home device (apnea hypopnea index <15 or oxygen desaturation index <10). MEASUREMENTS: Participants wore a wrist actigraphy monitor (Actiwatch(TM)) for 7days. During a clinical examination, participants completed questionnaires about sleep, other health behaviors, and medical history and had their blood pressure, anthropometric measures, and fasting blood glucose measured; metabolic risk factors were determined based on standard clinical guidelines. RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension, obesity, and diabetes was 17.1%, 5.5%, and 35.4%, respectively. Sleep duration was not associated with any cardiovascular risk factor. There was a significantly increased odds for hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.08) and obesity (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05) associated with higher sleep fragmentation (per 1%). There was also a significantly increased odds for hypertension associated with poorer self-reported sleep quality (OR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.05-1.24] per 1-unit higher Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score). CONCLUSION: Objective and self-reported sleep quality may be more important than duration in relation to prevalent hypertension."

OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND LEVELS OF EVIDENCE: Chapter 2: Screening and assessment for unhealthy alcohol use Screening Screening for unhealthy alcohol use and appropriate interventions should be implemented in general practice (Level A), hospitals (Level B), emergency departments and community health and welfare settings (Level C). Quantity-frequency measures can detect consumption that exceeds levels in the current Australian guidelines (Level B). The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is the most effective screening tool and is recommended for use in primary care and hospital settings. For screening in the general community, the AUDIT-C is a suitable alternative (Level A). Indirect biological markers should be used as an adjunct to screening (Level A), and direct measures of alcohol in breath and/or blood can be useful markers of recent use (Level B). Assessment Assessment should include evaluation of alcohol use and its effects, physical examination, clinical investigations and collateral history taking (Level C). Assessment for alcohol-related physical problems, mental health problems and social support should be undertaken routinely (GPP). Where there are concerns regarding the safety of the patient or others, specialist consultation is recommended (Level C). Assessment should lead to a clear, mutually acceptable treatment plan which specifies interventions to meet the patient's needs (Level D). Sustained abstinence is the optimal outcome for most patients with alcohol dependence (Level C). Chapter 3: Caring for and managing patients with alcohol problems: interventions, treatments, relapse prevention, aftercare, and long term follow-up Brief interventions Brief motivational interviewing interventions are more effective than no treatment for people who consume alcohol at risky levels (Level A). Their effectiveness compared with standard care or alternative psychosocial interventions varies by treatment setting. They are most effective in primary care settings (Level A). Psychosocial interventions Cognitive behaviour therapy should be a first-line psychosocial intervention for alcohol dependence. Its clinical benefit is enhanced when it is combined with pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence or an additional psychosocial intervention (eg, motivational interviewing) (Level A). Motivational interviewing is effective in the short term and in patients with less severe alcohol dependence (Level A). Residential rehabilitation may be of benefit to patients who have moderate-to-severe alcohol dependence and require a structured residential treatment setting (Level D). Alcohol withdrawal management Most cases of withdrawal can be managed in an ambulatory setting with appropriate support (Level B). Tapering diazepam regimens (Level A) with daily staged supply from a pharmacy or clinic are recommended (GPP). Pharmacotherapies for alcohol dependence Acamprosate is recommended to help maintain abstinence from alcohol (Level A). Naltrexone is recommended for prevention of relapse to heavy drinking (Level A). Disulfiram is only recommended in close supervision settings where patients are motivated for abstinence (Level A). Some evidence for off-label therapies baclofen and topiramate exists, but their side effect profiles are complex and neither should be a first-line medication (Level B). Peer support programs Peer-led support programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous and SMART Recovery are effective at maintaining abstinence or reductions in drinking (Level A). Relapse prevention, aftercare and long-term follow-up Return to problematic drinking is common and aftercare should focus on addressing factors that contribute to relapse (GPP). A harm-minimisation approach should be considered for patients who are unable to reduce their drinking (GPP). Chapter 4: Providing appropriate treatment and care to people with alcohol problems: a summary for key specific populations Gender-specific issues Screen women and men for domestic abuse (Level C). Consider child protection assessments for caregivers with alcohol use disorder (GPP). Explore contraceptive options with women of reproductive age who regularly consume alcohol (Level B). Pregnant and breastfeeding women Advise pregnant and breastfeeding women that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption (Level B). Pregnant women who are alcohol dependent should be admitted to hospital for treatment in an appropriate maternity unit that has an addiction specialist (GPP). Young people Perform a comprehensive HEEADSSS assessment for young people with alcohol problems (Level B). Treatment should focus on tangible benefits of reducing drinking through psychotherapy and engagement of family and peer networks (Level B). Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples Collaborate with Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander health workers, organisations and communities, and seek guidance on patient engagement approaches (GPP). Use validated screening tools and consider integrated mainstream and Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander-specific approaches to care (Level B). Culturally and linguistically diverse groups Use an appropriate method, such as the ""teach-back"" technique, to assess the need for language and health literacy support (Level C). Engage with culture-specific agencies as this can improve treatment access and success (Level C). Sexually diverse and gender diverse populations Be mindful that sexually diverse and gender diverse populations experience lower levels of satisfaction, connection and treatment completion (Level C). Seek to incorporate LGBTQ-specific treatment and agencies (Level C). Older people All new patients aged over 50 years should be screened for harmful alcohol use (Level D). Consider alcohol as a possible cause for older patients presenting with unexplained physical or psychological symptoms (Level D). Consider shorter acting benzodiazepines for withdrawal management (Level D). Cognitive impairment Cognitive impairment may impair engagement with treatment (Level A). Perform cognitive screening for patients who have alcohol problems and refer them for neuropsychological assessment if significant impairment is suspected (Level A). SUMMARY OF KEY RECOMMENDATIONS AND LEVELS OF EVIDENCE: Chapter 5: Understanding and managing comorbidities for people with alcohol problems: polydrug use and dependence, co-occurring mental disorders, and physical comorbidities Polydrug use and dependence Active alcohol use disorder, including dependence, significantly increases the risk of overdose associated with the administration of opioid drugs. Specialist advice is recommended before treatment of people dependent on both alcohol and opioid drugs (GPP). Older patients requiring management of alcohol withdrawal should have their use of pharmaceutical medications reviewed, given the prevalence of polypharmacy in this age group (GPP). Smoking cessation can be undertaken in patients with alcohol dependence and/or polydrug use problems; some evidence suggests varenicline may help support reduction of both tobacco and alcohol consumption (Level C). Co-occurring mental disorders More intensive interventions are needed for people with comorbid conditions, as this population tends to have more severe problems and carries a worse prognosis than those with single pathology (GPP). The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10 or K6) is recommended for screening for comorbid mental disorders in people presenting for alcohol use disorders (Level A). People with alcohol use disorder and comorbid mental disorders should be offered treatment for both disorders; care should be taken to coordinate intervention (Level C). Physical comorbidities Patients should be advised that alcohol use has no beneficial health effects. There is no clear risk-free threshold for alcohol intake. The safe dose for alcohol intake is dependent on many factors such as underlying liver disease, comorbidities, age and sex (Level A). In patients with alcohol use disorder, early recognition of the risk for liver cirrhosis is critical. Patients with cirrhosis should abstain from alcohol and should be offered referral to a hepatologist for liver disease management and to an addiction physician for management of alcohol use disorder (Level A). Alcohol abstinence reduces the risk of cancer and improves outcomes after a diagnosis of cancer (Level A)."

Assessment should lead to a clear, mutually acceptable treatment plan which specifies interventions to meet the patient's needs (Level D). Sustained abstinence is the optimal outcome for most patients with alcohol dependence (Level C). Chapter 3: Caring for and managing patients with alcohol problems: interventions, treatments, relapse prevention, aftercare, and long term follow-up Brief interventions Brief motivational interviewing interventions are more effective than no treatment for people who consume alcohol at risky levels (Level A). Their effectiveness compared with standard care or alternative psychosocial interventions varies by treatment setting. They are most effective in primary care settings (Level A). Psychosocial interventions Cognitive behaviour therapy should be a first-line psychosocial intervention for alcohol dependence. Its clinical benefit is enhanced when it is combined with pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence or an additional psychosocial intervention (eg, motivational interviewing) (Level A). Motivational interviewing is effective in the short term and in patients with less severe alcohol dependence (Level A). Residential rehabilitation may be of benefit to patients who have moderate-to-severe alcohol dependence and require a structured residential treatment setting (Level D). Alcohol withdrawal management Most cases of withdrawal can be managed in an ambulatory setting with appropriate support (Level B). Tapering diazepam regimens (Level A) with daily staged supply from a pharmacy or clinic are recommended (GPP). Pharmacotherapies for alcohol dependence Acamprosate is recommended to help maintain abstinence from alcohol (Level A). Naltrexone is recommended for prevention of relapse to heavy drinking (Level A). Disulfiram is only recommended in close supervision settings where patients are motivated for abstinence (Level A). Some evidence for off-label therapies baclofen and topiramate exists, but their side effect profiles are complex and neither should be a first-line medication (Level B). Peer support programs Peer-led support programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous and SMART Recovery are effective at maintaining abstinence or reductions in drinking (Level A). Relapse prevention, aftercare and long-term follow-up Return to problematic drinking is common and aftercare should focus on addressing factors that contribute to relapse (GPP). A harm-minimisation approach should be considered for patients who are unable to reduce their drinking (GPP). Chapter 4: Providing appropriate treatment and care to people with alcohol problems: a summary for key specific populations Gender-specific issues Screen women and men for domestic abuse (Level C). Consider child protection assessments for caregivers with alcohol use disorder (GPP). Explore contraceptive options with women of reproductive age who regularly consume alcohol (Level B). Pregnant and breastfeeding women Advise pregnant and breastfeeding women that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption (Level B). Pregnant women who are alcohol dependent should be admitted to hospital for treatment in an appropriate maternity unit that has an addiction specialist (GPP). Young people Perform a comprehensive HEEADSSS assessment for young people with alcohol problems (Level B). Treatment should focus on tangible benefits of reducing drinking through psychotherapy and engagement of family and peer networks (Level B). Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples Collaborate with Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander health workers, organisations and communities, and seek guidance on patient engagement approaches (GPP). Use validated screening tools and consider integrated mainstream and Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander-specific approaches to care (Level B). Culturally and linguistically diverse groups Use an appropriate method, such as the ""teach-back"" technique, to assess the need for language and health literacy support (Level C). Engage with culture-specific agencies as this can improve treatment access and success (Level C). Sexually diverse and gender diverse populations Be mindful that sexually diverse and gender diverse populations experience lower levels of satisfaction, connection and treatment completion (Level C). Seek to incorporate LGBTQ-specific treatment and agencies (Level C). Older people All new patients aged over 50 years should be screened for harmful alcohol use (Level D). Consider alcohol as a possible cause for older patients presenting with unexplained physical or psychological symptoms (Level D). Consider shorter acting benzodiazepines for withdrawal management (Level D). Cognitive impairment Cognitive impairment may impair engagement with treatment (Level A). Perform cognitive screening for patients who have alcohol problems and refer them for neuropsychological assessment if significant impairment is suspected (Level A). SUMMARY OF KEY RECOMMENDATIONS AND LEVELS OF EVIDENCE: Chapter 5: Understanding and managing comorbidities for people with alcohol problems: polydrug use and dependence, co-occurring mental disorders, and physical comorbidities Polydrug use and dependence Active alcohol use disorder, including dependence, significantly increases the risk of overdose associated with the administration of opioid drugs. Specialist advice is recommended before treatment of people dependent on both alcohol and opioid drugs (GPP). Older patients requiring management of alcohol withdrawal should have their use of pharmaceutical medications reviewed, given the prevalence of polypharmacy in this age group (GPP). Smoking cessation can be undertaken in patients with alcohol dependence and/or polydrug use problems; some evidence suggests varenicline may help support reduction of both tobacco and alcohol consumption (Level C). Co-occurring mental disorders More intensive interventions are needed for people with comorbid conditions, as this population tends to have more severe problems and carries a worse prognosis than those with single pathology (GPP). The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10 or K6) is recommended for screening for comorbid mental disorders in people presenting for alcohol use disorders (Level A). People with alcohol use disorder and comorbid mental disorders should be offered treatment for both disorders; care should be taken to coordinate intervention (Level C). Physical comorbidities Patients should be advised that alcohol use has no beneficial health effects. There is no clear risk-free threshold for alcohol intake. The safe dose for alcohol intake is dependent on many factors such as underlying liver disease, comorbidities, age and sex (Level A). In patients with alcohol use disorder, early recognition of the risk for liver cirrhosis is critical. Patients with cirrhosis should abstain from alcohol and should be offered referral to a hepatologist for liver disease management and to an addiction physician for management of alcohol use disorder (Level A). Alcohol abstinence reduces the risk of cancer and improves outcomes after a diagnosis of cancer (Level A)."

OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND LEVELS OF EVIDENCE: Chapter 2: Screening and assessment for unhealthy alcohol use Screening Screening for unhealthy alcohol use and appropriate interventions should be implemented in general practice (Level A), hospitals (Level B), emergency departments and community health and welfare settings (Level C). Quantity-frequency measures can detect consumption that exceeds levels in the current Australian guidelines (Level B). The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is the most effective screening tool and is recommended for use in primary care and hospital settings. For screening in the general community, the AUDIT-C is a suitable alternative (Level A). Indirect biological markers should be used as an adjunct to screening (Level A), and direct measures of alcohol in breath and/or blood can be useful markers of recent use (Level B). Assessment Assessment should include evaluation of alcohol use and its effects, physical examination, clinical investigations and collateral history taking (Level C). Assessment for alcohol-related physical problems, mental health problems and social support should be undertaken routinely (GPP).

PURPOSE: Risk factors for type II diabetes and diabetic retinopathy were determined in a population-based study of Mexican-Americans. DESIGN: Proyecto VER (Vision, Evaluation, and Research) is a cross-sectional study in a random sample of the self-described Hispanic populations in Tucson and Nogales, Arizona, age 40 and older. METHODS: Of 6,659 eligible subjects, 4,774 (72%) participated in the home questionnaire and clinic visit. Diabetes was defined as self-report of a physician diagnosis or hemoglobin A(1c) value of > or = 7.0%. Only type II diabetes was included. Diabetic retinopathy was assessed on stereo fundus photographs of all persons with diabetes. Questions were asked about demographic, personal, socioeconomic, and diabetes related variables. RESULTS: 1023 (21.4%) of the sample had type II diabetes, and 68% were in the low-income group (annual income less than $20,000). Diabetes was associated with Native-American ancestry, higher acculturation, low income, less education, and increasing body mass index after age and gender adjustment. Persons with previously undiscovered diabetes were more likely to have no regular source of care, no insurance, and currently smoke compared with persons with known diabetes. Only low income was related to proliferative retinopathy, once adjusted for other factors (odds ratio [OR] = 3.93, 95%, confidence limitations [CL] = 1.31-11.80). CONCLUSIONS: Several socioeconomic and other factors were associated with diabetes, but few were related to diabetic retinopathy. Persons in the low-income group appeared to be at greater risk of diabetes and the ocular complications of diabetes compared with those with more income. Further longitudinal studies in this population are needed to confirm the associations."

Persons with previously undiscovered diabetes were more likely to have no regular source of care, no insurance, and currently smoke compared with persons with known diabetes. Only low income was related to proliferative retinopathy, once adjusted for other factors (odds ratio [OR] = 3.93, 95%, confidence limitations [CL] = 1.31-11.80). CONCLUSIONS: Several socioeconomic and other factors were associated with diabetes, but few were related to diabetic retinopathy. Persons in the low-income group appeared to be at greater risk of diabetes and the ocular complications of diabetes compared with those with more income. Further longitudinal studies in this population are needed to confirm the associations."

OBJECTIVE: Folate and other methyl-group nutrients may play a key role in pancreatic carcinogenesis through their effects on DNA integrity. We examined the association between pancreatic cancer and intake of folate, vitamins B(6), B(12) and methionine in a large population-based case-control study. METHODS: Risk factor data were collected during in-person interviews with 532 pancreatic cancer cases diagnosed in 1995-1999 and 1,701 frequency-matched controls in the San Francisco Bay Area. Dietary history and supplement use were obtained using a semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire developed at Harvard University. Adjusted unconditional logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) as estimates of the relative risk. RESULTS: Total folate intake was inversely associated with pancreatic cancer (5th vs. 1st quintile: OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.48-0.93, p (trend) = 0.04). Increased vitamin B(12) from food was positively associated with pancreatic cancer although risk estimates for quintiles 3-5 were similar (5th vs. 1st quintile: OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.3-2.6, p (trend) = 0.001).

OBJECTIVE: The association of sedentary behaviour and leisure time physical activity with a validated continuous metabolic syndrome risk score was investigated in adults. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A number of 992 adults (559 men) without cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Subjects reported time spent in leisure time physical activity and television watching/computer activities. A validated metabolic syndrome risk score, based on waist circumference, triglycerides, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, was used. The metabolic syndrome risk score and time spent in sedentary behaviour and physical activity were analysed as continuous variables using multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Metabolic syndrome risk was positively associated with time spent watching television/computer activities, irrespective of physical activity level, and after adjustment for age, education level, smoking status and dietary intake in women aged > or =45 years (beta=0.184, P<0.05). Independent of the time being sedentary, moderate to vigorous leisure time physical activity was inversely associated with metabolic syndrome risk in men (<45 years: beta=-0.183, P<0.01; > or =45 years: beta=-0.192, P<0.01) and women aged > or =45 years (beta=-0.203, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Although cross-sectional, the present results support inclusion of efforts to decrease sedentary behaviour in metabolic syndrome prevention strategies for women aged > or =45 years, besides promotion of moderate to vigorous physical activity, since both behavioural changes might show additional effects."

Abuse of legal substances in India includes alcohol and tobacco, which are the major risk factors for various non-communicable diseases and deaths. The current pandemic has identified tobacco consumption as a risk factor for COVID-19, highlighting the need to control substance abuse. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of substance abuse in India and discuss the cost-effective public health strategies (such as yoga) to alleviate COVID-related anxiety in order to prevent substance abuse and its associated co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study reports the data on tobacco and alcohol abuse from a nationwide randomized two-arm diabetes control trial (Niyantrita Madhumeha Bharata, 2017) conducted by the Indian Yoga Association (IYA) through Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-VYASA), Bengaluru. Data of 30,354 participants who abuse tobacco and 30,159 participants who abuse alcohol were collected all over India. The prevalence is estimated at around 8.7% for alcohol abuse and 7.9% for tobacco abuse, Arunachal Pradesh state ranking the highest regarding both alcohol and tobacco abuse, while the Tripura state ranked the lowest. School and college-based mandatory yoga programs need to be implemented to prevent the increase of substance abuse in India to alleviate the psychosocial stress of adolescents and college-going students, besides the installation of the mindfulness-based diabetes yoga protocol (DYP) in the wellness centers of Ayushman Bharat."

Abuse of legal substances in India includes alcohol and tobacco, which are the major risk factors for various non-communicable diseases and deaths. The current pandemic has identified tobacco consumption as a risk factor for COVID-19, highlighting the need to control substance abuse. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of substance abuse in India and discuss the cost-effective public health strategies (such as yoga) to alleviate COVID-related anxiety in order to prevent substance abuse and its associated co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study reports the data on tobacco and alcohol abuse from a nationwide randomized two-arm diabetes control trial (Niyantrita Madhumeha Bharata, 2017) conducted by the Indian Yoga Association (IYA) through Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-VYASA), Bengaluru.

Using newly available food composition data for carotenoids, the authors reanalyzed a population-based case-control study of diet and lung cancer conducted in Hawaii in 1983-1985 (L. Le Marchand et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 81: 1158-1164, 1989). The analysis included interviews with 230 men and 102 women with lung cancer and 597 men and 268 women as controls, frequency-matched to the patients by age and sex. A previously validated quantitative diet history assessed the usual intake of foods rich in carotenoids. After adjusting for smoking and other covariates, no association was found with lung cancer risk for dietary lycopene or beta-cryptoxanthin intake, whereas dose-dependent inverse associations of comparable magnitude were found for dietary beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and lutein. When subjects were cross-classified by their joint intakes of the latter three carotenoids, those who had a high intake (> median) for all three had the lowest risk for lung cancer. In a similar two-way interaction analysis, the previously reported inverse association of lung cancer with vegetable consumption in these data was found to be stronger than that with intake of these three carotenoids. Consistent with our previous findings, this analysis provides further evidence for a protective effect of certain carotenoids against lung cancer and for the greater protection afforded by consuming a variety of vegetables compared to only foods rich in a particular carotenoid."

Little epidemiologic research has focused on the mental health effects of gender-based violence among sub-Saharan African women. The objective of this study was to assess risk of depression and depressive symptoms among 1,102 female undergraduate students who were victims of gender-based violence. Students who reported experience of any gender-based violence were nearly twice as likely to be classified as having moderate depression during the academic year (OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.39-2.82) as compared with nonabused students. Compared with nonabused students, those who had experienced both physical and sexual abuse were 4 times more likely to report either moderately severe (OR = 4.32, 95% CI = 2.00-9.31) or severe depressive symptoms (OR = 4.19, 95% CI = 1.01-17.43). Our findings, consistent with previous studies, support the thesis that women's mental health status is adversely affected by exposure to gender-based violence."

Obesity affects approximately one-third of all U.S. adults, presenting a large economic and public health burden.

This study sought to investigate the association between long work hours, leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), and obesity across levels of occupational activity in order to identify potentially vulnerable groups. Cross sectional analysis was performed in 2017 using data from the 2015 Georgia Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and prevalence ratios were estimated across work hour and occupational activity groups. Ability to meet guidelines for LTPA did not differ significantly across work hour categories overall. Those working in low activity occupations were more likely to meet aerobic guidelines for LTPA compared to those in intermediate and high activity occupations (chi(2): 19.3; P-value: <0.01). Results of interaction assessment demonstrate that the effects of work hours on obesity risk and meeting aerobic guidelines are significantly different across OA categories, indicating OA to be an effect modifier of the relationship between long work hours and obesity (chi(2): 13.33; P-value: <0.001; chi(2): 4.42; P-value: <0.05).

BACKGROUND: Amphetamines have been reported to cause myocardial infarct, cerebral hemorrhage, aortic dissection, hypertension, vasculitis, aneurysms, and, occasionally, death from direct toxicity. To date, there have been no reports of coronary intimal hyperplasia in an amphetamine user. METHODS: A 29-year-old male was found collapsed after jogging. He had been taking amphetamines for 11 years for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Past medical history was positive for mild hypertension and migraine headaches. He underwent a complete autopsy and drug screen. RESULTS: At gross autopsy his left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery was occluded and he had an old myocardial infarct in the anterior wall of the left ventricle. Microscopic findings included occlusive intimal hyperplasia (positive for smooth muscle actin) in the LAD and an old left ventricular anterior wall infarct surrounded by acute infarct. CONCLUSION: In addition to other reported adverse effects, amphetamines can also cause occlusive intimal hyperplasia of the coronary arteries."

CMV acquisition	hygiene	Prevents	15967030	train	T18	T7	1215:1230	1260:1267	"Washing our hands of the congenital cytomegalovirus disease epidemic. 
BACKGROUND: Each year in the United States, an estimated 40,000 children are born with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, causing an estimated 400 deaths and leaving approximately 8000 children with permanent disabilities such as hearing or vision loss, or mental retardation. More children are affected by serious CMV-related disabilities than by several better-known childhood maladies, including Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, and spina bifida. DISCUSSION: Congenital CMV is a prime target for prevention not only because of its substantial disease burden but also because the biology and epidemiology of CMV suggest that there are ways to reduce viral transmission. Because exposure to the saliva or urine of young children is a major cause of CMV infection among pregnant women, it is likely that good personal hygiene, especially hand-washing, can reduce the risk of CMV acquisition. Experts agree that such measures are likely to be efficacious (i.e., they will work if consistently followed) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that physicians counsel pregnant women about preventing CMV acquisition through careful attention to hygiene. However, because of concerns about effectiveness (i.e., Will women consistently follow hygienic practices as the result of interventions?), the medical and public health communities appear reluctant to embrace primary CMV prevention via improved hygienic practices, and educational interventions are rare. Current data on the effectiveness of such measures in preventing CMV infection are promising, but limited. There is strong evidence, however, that educational interventions can prevent other infectious diseases with similar transmission modes, suggesting that effective interventions can also be found for CMV. Until a CMV vaccine becomes available, effective educational interventions are needed to inform women about congenital CMV prevention. SUMMARY: Perhaps no single cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities in the United States currently provides greater opportunity for improved outcomes in more children than congenital CMV. Given the present state of knowledge, women deserve to be informed about how they can reduce their risk of CMV infection during pregnancy, and trials are needed to identify effective educational interventions."

OBJECTIVE: To explore the related ischemic stroke (IS) risk factors in youth and the importance of sleep quality in young ischemic stroke. METHODS: A total of 219 patients aged 18 to 45 years (166 males, 53 females) with an initial onset of ischemic stroke from First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University and Puyang People's Hospital during June 2011 to February 2013, were recruited as the study cases. Meanwhile 231 patients aged 46 to 80 years (170 males, 61 females) from the same hospitals were selected as the elderly control group. And 149 young persons aged 18 to 45 years undergoing normal physical examinations from the same hospitals were taken as youth control group. For all cases, their ischemic stroke related risk factors and especially the importance of sleep quality were analyzed. Prospective analyses were conducted to re-considerate the related ischemic stroke risk factors in youth. RESULTS: Hypertension history, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking and drinking, bad sleep quality, family history of stroke and hyperhomocysteinemia were associated with the onset of young ischemic stroke. The decreasing exposure rates were history of hypertension, smoking, poor sleep quality, hyperlipidemia, alcoholism, hyperhomocysteinemia and a family history of stroke and diabetes. In ischemic stroke young patients, bad sleep quality accounted for 55.7% and ranked third among all risk factors. CONCLUSION: The risk factors of young ischemic stroke ranks are different with other studies.

OBJECTIVE: Although animal studies suggest an inverse association between consumption of plant foods and risk of colorectal cancer, many observational data have failed to support such an association. We prospectively examined the association between dietary intakes of fruit, vegetables, and fiber and colorectal cancer risk in a large female cohort from the Women's Health Study. METHODS: Among 39,876 healthy women aged >/=45 years at baseline, 36,976 with baseline self-reported information on dietary intakes and other risk factors for colorectal cancer were included in the analyses. During an average follow-up of 10 years, 223 women were diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Intakes of fruit, vegetables, and fiber were assessed by a baseline food-frequency questionnaire. The analyses were carried out using the Cox proportional hazards regression and all tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Intakes of fruit, vegetables, and the specific subgroups were not found to be associated with colorectal cancer risk. Multivariate relative risks (RRs) comparing the highest with lowest quintile were 0.79 (95% CI=0.49-1.27,p for trend =0.30) for fruit intake, and 0.88 (95% CI=0.56-1.38,p for trend=0.30) for vegetables intake. Similarly, intake of total fiber was not associated with colorectal cancer risk; the RR for the highest relative to lowest quintile was 0.75 (95% CI=0.48-1.17,p for trend=0.12). However, higher intake of legume fiber was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer; the RR for the highest versus slowest quintile was 0.60 (95% CI=0.40-0.91,p for trend=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our data offer little support for associations between intakes of fruit, vegetables, and fiber, and colorectal cancer risk. However, our data suggest that legume fiber and/or other related sources may reduce risk of colorectal cancer."

However, higher intake of legume fiber was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer; the RR for the highest versus slowest quintile was 0.60 (95% CI=0.40-0.91,p for trend=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our data offer little support for associations between intakes of fruit, vegetables, and fiber, and colorectal cancer risk.

OBJECTIVE: Although animal studies suggest an inverse association between consumption of plant foods and risk of colorectal cancer, many observational data have failed to support such an association. We prospectively examined the association between dietary intakes of fruit, vegetables, and fiber and colorectal cancer risk in a large female cohort from the Women's Health Study. METHODS: Among 39,876 healthy women aged >/=45 years at baseline, 36,976 with baseline self-reported information on dietary intakes and other risk factors for colorectal cancer were included in the analyses. During an average follow-up of 10 years, 223 women were diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Intakes of fruit, vegetables, and fiber were assessed by a baseline food-frequency questionnaire.

We aimed to identify the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) as a serum biomarker of symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic plaque in North Indian population. Individuals with symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic plaque have high risk of ischemic stroke. Previous studies from western countries have shown an association between VEGF and MCP-1 levels and the incidence of ischemic stroke. In this study, venous blood from 110 human subjects was collected, 57 blood samples of which were obtained from patients with carotid plaques, 38 neurological controls without carotid plaques, and another 15 healthy controls who had no history of serious illness. Serum VEGF and MCP-1 levels were measured using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We also correlated the data clinically and carried out risk factor analysis based on the detailed questionnaire obtained from each patient. For risk factor analysis, a total of 70 symptomatic carotid plaque cases and equal number of age and sex matched healthy controls were analyzed. We found that serum VEGF levels in carotid plaque patients did not show any significant change when compared to either of the controls. Similarly, there was no significant upregulation of MCP-1 in the serum of these patients. The risk factor analysis revealed that hypertension, diabetes, and physical inactivity were the main correlates of carotid atherosclerosis (p < 0.05). Prevalence of patients was higher residing in urban areas as compared to rural region. We also found that patients coming from mountain region were relatively less vulnerable to cerebral atherosclerosis as compared to the ones residing at non mountain region. On the contrary, smoking, obesity, dyslipidemia, alcohol consumption, and tobacco chewing were not observed as the determinants of carotid atherosclerosis risk in North India (p > 0.05). We conclude that the pathogenesis of carotid plaques may progress independent of these inflammatory molecules. In parallel, risk factor analysis indicates hypertension, diabetes, and sedentary lifestyle as the most significant risk factors of ischemic stroke identified in North India. This could be helpful in early identification of subjects at risk for stroke and devising health care strategies."

Developing and underdeveloped countries on the other hand have lower mortality even with higher rural and slum populations along with incidence of diarrhea because of lack of sanitation. We analyzed data from 122 countries out of which 80 were high or upper middle income and 42 were low or low middle income countries. There was statistically significant positive correlation between COVID 19 deaths /million population and water current score, health efficiency, and HALE. Statistically significant negative correlation was observed with % rural population and fraction of diarrhea because of inadequate sanitation for all ages. Moreover analysis of 51 countries showed that there is significant negative correlation between COVID 19 deaths /million population and proportion of total population living in slums. We propose that high microbial exposure particularly gram negative bacteria can possibly induce interferon type I which might have a protective effect against COVID 19 since the countries with less mortality also tend to have lack of sanitation and high incidence of attendant diseases. So, far none of the predictive models have taken into account immune status of populations engendered by environmental microbial exposure or microbiome.

Developing and underdeveloped countries on the other hand have lower mortality even with higher rural and slum populations along with incidence of diarrhea because of lack of sanitation. We analyzed data from 122 countries out of which 80 were high or upper middle income and 42 were low or low middle income countries. There was statistically significant positive correlation between COVID 19 deaths /million population and water current score, health efficiency, and HALE. Statistically significant negative correlation was observed with % rural population and fraction of diarrhea because of inadequate sanitation for all ages. Moreover analysis of 51 countries showed that there is significant negative correlation between COVID 19 deaths /million population and proportion of total population living in slums. We propose that high microbial exposure particularly gram negative bacteria can possibly induce interferon type I which might have a protective effect against COVID 19 since the countries with less mortality also tend to have lack of sanitation and high incidence of attendant diseases. So, far none of the predictive models have taken into account immune status of populations engendered by environmental microbial exposure or microbiome. There might be a need to look at dynamics of COVID 19 pandemic using immune perspective. The approach can potentially inform better policies including interventions."

Background: HIV infection disproportionally affects African Americans. Liver disease is a major cause of non-HIV morbidity and mortality in this population. Substance abuse accelerates HIV disease and may facilitate progression of liver disease. This study investigated the relationship between sex differences and cocaine use with liver injury, characterized as hepatic fibrosis. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 544 African Americans [369 people living with HIV (PLWH) and 175 HIV seronegative] from the Miami Adult Studies on HIV (MASH) cohort. Cocaine use was determined with a validated self-reported questionnaire and confirmed with urine screen. Fasting blood was used to estimate liver fibrosis using the noninvasive fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index. Results: Men living with HIV had 1.79 times higher odds for liver fibrosis than women living with HIV (p = 0.038). African American women had higher CD4 count (p = 0.001) and lower HIV viral load (p = 0.011) compared to African American men. Fewer women (PLWH and HIV seronegative) smoked cigarettes (p = 0.002), and fewer had hazardous or harmful alcohol use (p < 0.001) than men. Women also had higher body mass index (kg/m(2)) (p < 0.001) compared to men. No significant association was noted among HIV seronegative participants for liver fibrosis by sex differences or cocaine use. Among African Americans living with HIV, cocaine users were 1.68 times more likely to have liver fibrosis than cocaine nonusers (p = 0.044). Conclusions: Sex differences and cocaine use appear to affect liver disease among African Americans living with HIV pointing to the importance of identifying at-risk individuals to improve outcomes of liver disease."

BACKGROUND: Several epidemiologic studies have reported an increased risk of prostate cancer among farmers. Our aim was to assess the risk of developing prostate cancer in relation to exposure to specific active compounds in pesticides. METHOD: A case-control approach was used with 1,516 prostate cancer patients and 4,994 age-matched internal controls consisting of all other cancer sites excluding lung cancer and cancers of unknown primary site. Lifetime occupational history was obtained through a self-administered questionnaire and used in conjunction with a job exposure matrix to estimate the participants' lifetime cumulative exposure to approximately 180 active compounds in pesticides. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess prostate cancer risk, adjusting for potential confounding variables and effect modifiers. These include age, ethnicity, alcohol consumption, smoking, education, and proxy respondent. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The significant association between prostate cancer risk and exposure to DDT (OR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.04-2.70 for high exposure), simazine (OR = 1.89; 95% CI: 1.08-3.33 for high exposure), and lindane (OR = 2.02; 95% CI: 1.15-3.55 for high exposure) is in keeping with those previously reported in the literature.

From two areas in the Province of Padova, we selected 2,283 male farmers who worked either in cattle raising or in crop/orchard cultivation. There were 422 cohort deaths from 1970 to 1992. Using the regional population as a reference, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on the Poisson distribution. Cancer mortality was significantly reduced among the 1,561 dairy farmers (SMR = 0.65; CI = 0.53-0.81); there was a significant decrease in lung cancer (SMR = 0.49; CI = 0.31-0.74), whereas a significant increase from brain tumors was found (SMR = 2.83; CI = 1.04-6.17). Neither overall cancer mortality nor the lung cancer SMR deviated significantly from unity for the 722 crop/orchard farmers. Among dairy farmers, moreover, lung cancer SMRs showed a significant downward trend across the quartiles of increasing length of work, 0.96 in the first quartile, and 0.48, 0.40, and 0.25 in the second, third, and fourth quartiles, respectively. Moreover, lung cancer risk decreased with increasing farm land area, with SMRs in the quartiles of 0.89, 0.37, 0.41 and 0.19. This decrease cannot be attributed to either a selection (healthy worker effect) or a confounding (lower percentage of smokers) bias. Nor was it due to an artifact introduced by differences in age distribution among the quartiles. Dairy farmers are known to be exposed to higher airborne endotoxin concentrations; reasonably, this cumulative exposure increases further with years of work and area of farm. Endotoxins may have protected the dairy farmers against lung cancer through the tumor necrosis factor produced by alveolar macrophages."
anxiety	moderate-intensity exercise training	Controls	32678068	train	T25	T7	213:220	124:160	"Reducing Anxiety and Anxiety Sensitivity With High-Intensity Interval Training in Adults With Asthma. 
BACKGROUND: Low- and moderate-intensity exercise training has been shown to be effective for reducing general anxiety and anxiety sensitivity among adults with asthma. Exercise frequency and intensity have been shown to play an integral role in reducing anxiety sensitivity; however, less is known about the impact of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on anxiety in adults with asthma. METHODS: A 6-week HIIT intervention was conducted with adults with asthma. Participants completed HIIT (10% peak power output for 1 min, 90% peak power output for 1 min, repeated 10 times) 3 times per week on a cycle ergometer. Preintervention and postintervention assessments included the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 and the Body Sensations Questionnaire.

BACKGROUND: Low- and moderate-intensity exercise training has been shown to be effective for reducing general anxiety and anxiety sensitivity among adults with asthma. Exercise frequency and intensity have been shown to play an integral role in reducing anxiety sensitivity; however, less is known about the impact of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on anxiety in adults with asthma. METHODS: A 6-week HIIT intervention was conducted with adults with asthma. Participants completed HIIT (10% peak power output for 1 min, 90% peak power output for 1 min, repeated 10 times) 3 times per week on a cycle ergometer. Preintervention and postintervention assessments included the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 and the Body Sensations Questionnaire.

Narcolepsy	rapid eye movement sleep	positive_statistical_association	31143939	train	T3	T4	121:131	181:205	"Increased creative thinking in narcolepsy. 
Some studies suggest a link between creativity and rapid eye movement sleep. Narcolepsy is characterized by falling asleep directly into rapid eye movement sleep, states of dissociated wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep (cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and lucid dreaming) and a high dream recall frequency. Lucid dreaming (the awareness of dreaming while dreaming) has been correlated with creativity. Given their life-long privileged access to rapid eye movement sleep and dreams, we hypothesized that subjects with narcolepsy may have developed high creative abilities. To test this assumption, 185 subjects with narcolepsy and 126 healthy controls were evaluated for their level of creativity with two questionnaires, the Test of Creative Profile and the Creativity Achievement Questionnaire. Creativity was also objectively tested in 30 controls and 30 subjects with narcolepsy using the Evaluation of Potential Creativity test battery, which measures divergent and convergent modes of creative thinking in the graphic and verbal domains, using concrete and abstract problems. Subjects with narcolepsy obtained higher scores than controls on the Test of Creative Profile (mean +/- standard deviation: 58.9 +/- 9.6 versus 55.1 +/- 10, P = 0.001), in the three creative profiles (Innovative, Imaginative and Researcher) and on the Creative Achievement Questionnaire (10.4 +/- 25.7 versus 6.4 +/- 7.6, P = 0.047). They also performed better than controls on the objective test of creative performance (4.3 +/- 1.5 versus 3.7 +/- 1.4; P = 0.009). Most symptoms of narcolepsy (including sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, lucid dreaming, and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, but not cataplexy) were associated with higher scores on the Test of Creative Profile. These results highlight a higher creative potential in subjects with narcolepsy and further support a role of rapid eye movement sleep in creativity."

dyslipidemia	Sleep duration	Statistically_associated	22578889	train	T2	T1	34:46	0:14	"Sleep duration is associated with dyslipidemia in patients with bipolar disorder in clinical remission. 
BACKGROUND: The pathways to increased cardiovascular risk in bipolar disorder include health behaviors, psychosocial stress and long-term medication exposure. However, the evidence that the association between cardiovascular risk factors and bipolar disorder remains significant after controlling for these co-factors suggests that additional important risk factors have yet to be identified. Our hypothesis is that disturbances in the sleep-wake cycle are an important and under-recognized pathway through which affective disorders lead to increased cardiovascular risk. METHODS: In patients with bipolar disorder type 1 in clinical remission, we: 1) explored whether sleep disturbance predicted the endorsement of NCEP ATP-III criteria for dyslipidemia, independent of other lifestyle factors and 2) tested the association between low HDL (NCEP-ATP III) and sleep duration measured with actigraphy over an eight-day period. RESULTS: Median sleep duration is significantly associated with low HDL. The risk of having low HDL increases by 1.23 with every 30 minutes of reduced sleep time. LIMITATIONS: Since sleep patterns in patients with bipolar disorder are variable and irregular, it is possible that other sleep characteristics, not present during the span of our study, or the variability itself may be what drives the increased cardiovascular risk. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep characteristics of patients with bipolar disorder in clinical remission are associated with cardiovascular risk. More specifically, sleep duration was associated with low HDL. Clinicians should pay special attention to sleep hygiene in treating individuals with bipolar disorder, even when they are in clinical remission."

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have indicated that physical activity reduces the risk of developing breast cancer. More recently, sedentary behavior has been suggested as a risk factor independent of physical activity level. The purpose of the present study was to investigate occupational sedentariness and breast cancer risk in pre- and postmenopausal women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a population-based prospective cohort study (n = 29 524), working history was assessed by a questionnaire between 1990 and 1992. Participants were classified as having: (1) sedentary occupations only; (2) mixed occupations or (3) non-sedentary occupations only. The association between occupational sedentariness and breast cancer incidence was analyzed by Cox regression, adjusted for known risk factors and participation in competitive sports. RESULTS: Women with a working history of occupational sedentariness had a significantly increased risk of breast cancer (adjusted HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.05, 1.37) compared with those with mixed or non-sedentary occupations. The association was stronger among women younger than 55 years (adjusted HR 1.54; 95% CI 1.20, 1.96), whereas no association was seen in women 55 years or older. Adjustment for participation in competitive sports did not change the association. CONCLUSIONS: We found that occupational sedentariness was associated with increased breast cancer risk, especially in women younger than 55 years.

lung cancers	cigarette smoking	positive_statistical_association	9517586	train	T4	T28	134:146	178:195	"Association of cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure with location and histology of lung cancer. 
Prior studies have suggested that lung cancers that arise in association with cigarette smoking favor an upper-lobe location while those associated with asbestos exposure favor a lower-lobe location. An excess of adenocarcinomas has also been reported among cases not exposed to cigarette smoke as well as among those exposed to asbestos. However, these studies typically have not adjusted adequately for potential confounders such as the patient's age, sex, race, or family history of cancer. To better examine the effects of cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure on location and histology of lung cancer, we analyzed data from a large case-control study that included 456 patients with stage I or II lung cancer. Patients with upper-lobe tumors tended to have had more exposure to tobacco as assessed by pack-years smoked (54.7 versus 46.2, p = 0.07) and less time since quitting smoking (3.0 versus 5.5 yr, p = 0.05). In contrast to some prior reports, asbestos exposure was also associated with an upper-lobe location of tumor. Among those with upper-lobe tumors, 14.6% had a history of significant asbestos exposure compared with 5.4% of those with lower-lobe tumors (p < 0.01). The relationship between asbestos exposure and upper-lobe location of tumor was also statistically significant whether stratified by smoking or analyzed by multivariable logistic regression modeling. Adenocarcinomas were more likely among those with less exposure to cigarette smoke based on fewer pack-years smoked (41.5 versus 61.8, p = 0.0001) and more time since quitting smoking (5.0 versus 3.0 yr, p = 0.02).

Prior studies have suggested that lung cancers that arise in association with cigarette smoking favor an upper-lobe location while those associated with asbestos exposure favor a lower-lobe location. An excess of adenocarcinomas has also been reported among cases not exposed to cigarette smoke as well as among those exposed to asbestos. However, these studies typically have not adjusted adequately for potential confounders such as the patient's age, sex, race, or family history of cancer. To better examine the effects of cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure on location and histology of lung cancer, we analyzed data from a large case-control study that included 456 patients with stage I or II lung cancer. Patients with upper-lobe tumors tended to have had more exposure to tobacco as assessed by pack-years smoked (54.7 versus 46.2, p = 0.07) and less time since quitting smoking (3.0 versus 5.5 yr, p = 0.05). In contrast to some prior reports, asbestos exposure was also associated with an upper-lobe location of tumor. Among those with upper-lobe tumors, 14.6% had a history of significant asbestos exposure compared with 5.4% of those with lower-lobe tumors (p < 0.01).

Patients with upper-lobe tumors tended to have had more exposure to tobacco as assessed by pack-years smoked (54.7 versus 46.2, p = 0.07) and less time since quitting smoking (3.0 versus 5.5 yr, p = 0.05). In contrast to some prior reports, asbestos exposure was also associated with an upper-lobe location of tumor. Among those with upper-lobe tumors, 14.6% had a history of significant asbestos exposure compared with 5.4% of those with lower-lobe tumors (p < 0.01). The relationship between asbestos exposure and upper-lobe location of tumor was also statistically significant whether stratified by smoking or analyzed by multivariable logistic regression modeling. Adenocarcinomas were more likely among those with less exposure to cigarette smoke based on fewer pack-years smoked (41.5 versus 61.8, p = 0.0001) and more time since quitting smoking (5.0 versus 3.0 yr, p = 0.02). The proportion of patients with significant exposure to asbestos was lower among those with adenocarcinomas but was not statistically significant (9.5 versus 15.3%, p = 0.09). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, longer time since smoking exposure remained a significant predictor of adenocarcinomas (p < 0.02), but history of asbestos exposure did not predict tumor histology. Thus, in patients with lung cancer, both cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure histories favor an upper-lobe location of tumor. Longer time since smoking exposure favors adenocarcinomas, but the history of asbestos exposure does not appear to influence the tumor histology."

BACKGROUND: To develop updated estimates in response to new exposure and exposure-response data of the burden of diarrhoea, respiratory infections, malnutrition, schistosomiasis, malaria, soil-transmitted helminth infections and trachoma from exposure to inadequate drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene behaviours (WASH) with a focus on low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: For each of the analysed diseases, exposure levels with both sufficient global exposure data for 2016 and a matching exposure-response relationship were combined into population-attributable fractions. Attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were estimated for each disease and, for most of the diseases, by country, age and sex group separately for inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene behaviours and for the cluster of risk factors. Uncertainty estimates were computed on the basis of uncertainty surrounding exposure estimates and relative risks. FINDINGS: An estimated 829,000 WASH-attributable deaths and 49.8 million DALYs occurred from diarrhoeal diseases in 2016, equivalent to 60% of all diarrhoeal deaths. In children under 5 years, 297,000 WASH-attributable diarrhoea deaths occurred, representing 5.3% of all deaths in this age group. If the global disease burden from different diseases and several counterfactual exposure distributions was combined it would amount to 1.6 million deaths, representing 2.8% of all deaths, and 104.6 million DALYs in 2016. CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent declines in attributable mortality, inadequate WASH remains an important determinant of global disease burden, especially among young children. These estimates contribute to global monitoring such as for the Sustainable Development Goal indicator on mortality from inadequate WASH."

Subclinical liver cirrhosis diagnosed by ultrasonography was significantly associated with the risk for HCC (multivariate-adjusted relative risk (RR) = 11.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.9-35.8). By multivariate analysis, the significant risk factors found for liver cirrhosis in HBsAg carriers were age, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) carrier status, chronic hepatitis manifested by sustained elevated serum aminotransferase levels for > or = 6 months, cigarette smoking, non-A blood types, and low educational levels.

The human coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic. Social distancing, hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment dominate the current fight against COVID-19. In developing countries, the need for clean water provision, sanitation and hygiene has only received limited attention. The current perspective examines the latest evidence on the occurrence, persistence and faecal-oral transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent causing COVID-19. Evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 proliferate in the human gastrointestinal system, and is shed via faeces. SARS-CoV-2 can survive and remain viable for up to 6 to 9 days on surfaces. Recent wastewater-based epidemiological studies from several countries also detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw wastewaters. Shell disorder analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a rigid outer shell conferring resilience, and a low shell disorder conferring moderate potential for faecal-oral transmission. Taken together, these findings point to potential faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which may partly explain its rapid transmission. Three potential mechanisms may account for SARS-CoV-2 faecal-oral transmission: (1) untreated contaminated drinking water, (2) raw and poorly cooked marine and aquatic foods from contaminated sources, (3) raw wastewater-based vegetatble production systems (e.g., salads) and aquaculture, and (4) vector-mediated transmission from faecal sources to foods, particularly those from open markets and street vending. SARS-CoV-2 faecal-oral transmission could be particularly high in developing countries due to several risk factors, including; (1) poor drinking water, wastewater and sanitation infrastructure, (2) poor hygiene and food handling practices, (3) unhygienic and rudimentary funeral practices, including home burials close to drinking water sources, and (4) poor social security and health care systems with low capacity to cope with disease outbreaks. Hence, clean drinking water provision, proper sanitation, food safety and hygiene could be critical in the current fight against COVID-19.

METHODS: Data from n = 16,622 adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2007-2012) were used to examine how the association between obesity and self-reported sleep duration varied by total number of prescription medications used in the past 30 days and by select classes of prescription medications including anxiolytics/sedatives/hypnotics, antidepressants, sleep aids, anticonvulsants, thyroid agents, and metabolic agents. RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses showed a significant inverse linear association of sleep duration and obesity, regardless of the total number of prescription medications individuals were taking. Each additional hour of sleep was associated with a 10% decrease in the odds of obesity. Results suggest that increased sleep duration is associated with lower odds of having obesity overall, even for long-duration sleepers (>=9 h), and this association does not differ for those taking antidepressants, thyroid agents, metabolic agents, and multiple prescription medications. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between sleep duration and obesity was similar among all prescription medication users and nonusers. The potential for a nonlinear association between sleep duration and obesity may be important to examine in some specific prescription medication classes."

Based on the biological activity of arachidonic acid metabolites, we hypothesized that alterations in the consumption of linoleic acid, the precursor to arachidonic acid, would result in a modification in tumor development when fed during the tumor promotion stage of the mouse skin initiation-promotion model. The effects of seven different levels of dietary linoleic acid (LA), supplied as corn oil in a 15% fat diet, on the incidence and rate of papilloma and carcinoma development were determined. SENCAR mice were placed on one of the experimental diets, containing 1.0, 3.6, 6.0, 7.9, 9.9, 12.5, or 15.0% corn oil, 1 week after initiation with 10 nmol of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene and 3 weeks prior to the start of twice weekly promotion with 1 micrograms 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). At 15 weeks of TPA treatment there were significant differences in papilloma number among diet groups, such that an inverse correlation (r = 0.92) was observed between tumor number and level of corn oil; the lowest corn oil diet group had an average of 11.7 tumors/mouse, while the highest corn oil group had 5.4 tumors/mouse. However, there was little difference in tumor incidence among diet groups. A general relationship between diet and carcinoma incidence was also found, such that the highest corn oil diet group had the lowest carcinoma incidence. In an experiment performed with DBA/2 mice, the average number of papillomas/mouse at 17 weeks was 4.5 (1.0% corn oil), 5.6 (7.9%) corn oil), and 2.3 (15.0% corn oil). Papilloma incidence was also affected by diet, with a 79% incidence for the 15.0% corn oil and an incidence of 93% for the 1.0% corn oil group. analyses of the fatty acid composition of epidermal phospholipids in mice fed the experimental diets reflected the dietary LA levels, in that an accumulation of phospholipid LA, accompanied by an overall decrease in arachidonic acid, occurred with increasing dietary corn oil.

HS	cigarette smoking	positive_statistical_association	34477078	train	T33	T30	840:842	846:863	"Two Cases of Hidradenitis Suppurativa Treated with Adalimumab at the Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Clinical Hospital Mostar. 
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease primarily affecting apocrine gland-rich areas of the body and presenting with painful nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts, and scarring (1). HS is a defect of the follicular epithelium; some have therefore called for the naming the disease acne inversa instead of hidradenitis suppurativa. The term acne inversa links the pathogenesis to acne and reflects the fact that it is an expression of follicular occlusion in localizations inverse to acne vulgaris (2). HS typically occurs after puberty. Studies have shown that the average onset is in the second or third decades of life (3). One of the most frequently cited risk factors for HS is cigarette smoking. Another significant risk factor for HS is obesity. About one-third of patients with HS have reported a family history of the disease (4). A clinically relevant staging and disease severity assessment is essential for the development of evidence-based treatments. There are several scoring systems for the assessment of disease severity of HS, including Hurley staging, HS Physician's Global Assessment (PGA), the modified Sartorius score (MSS), and the HS Severity Index (HSSI). Each of these assessments has both advantages and limitations in daily practice; there is currently no gold standard (5-8). The Hurley staging system is the simplest and most widely used instrument for HS classification in routine clinical practice. It classifies HS into three stages. HS-PGA is relatively easy to apply and is frequently used to measure clinical improvement in clinical trials of medical treatments (5). The system describes six disease stages, increasing in severity on a scale from 1 to 6 (9). MSS is a more detailed and dynamic classification system based on the counting of individual nodules and fistulas within seven anatomical regions. The system, which was developed by Sartorius et al. and later modified, is the first disease-specific instrument for dynamically measuring clinical severity of HS (10). The treatment of HS includes topical clindamycin, triamcinolone acetonide, clobetasol, topical resorcinol, oral antibiotics, hormonal therapy, oral retinoids, and biologic therapies (11). Biologic therapies are increasingly used in patients who fail to sufficiently respond to antibiotic and hormonal treatments. Adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept have all been tested in the treatment of HS but vary in effectiveness and in how well they have been studied. Subcutaneous weekly adalimumab (160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg each week thereafter) is the only biologic agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) for the treatment of HS, and it is recommended as first-line therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe disease who are intolerant or unresponsive to oral antibiotics (12). The first male patient aged 59 years was referred to our Department with very long history of HS. The first symptoms had been unrecognized and presented as a pilonidal cyst 25 years ago as well as cysts on the intergluteal region treated with multiple surgical interventions and systemic antibiotics. The first hospitalization at our Department was in 2016. In addition to HS, the patient had diabetes mellitus (DM) type II and hypertension. A physical examination showed multiple abscesses, fistulas, and nodules in the axillary, inguinal, perianal, gluteal, and intergluteal regions; Hurley staging: stage II, PGA staging: IV, DLQI: 24 (Figure 1, Figure 2). Microbiological repeated swabs showed numerous bacteria such as Esch.coli, S.aureus, Serratia.spp, Enterococcus spp, St.epidermidis, and Proteus mirabilis. Laboratory tests which included complete blood cell count, biochemistry, serology for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B and C infection together with chest X-rays were all within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasound examination found no abnormalities. Quantiferon test was positive. After the monotherapy with isoniazid, a repeated Quantiferon test two months later was negative. The patient was treated with betadine solution and pus drainage until 2018, when at the Department of Dermatology and Venerology prescribed adalimumab in doses of 80 mg initially, 40 mg x2 on the first day and the day after that, then 80 mg after fifteen days followed by 40 mg every ten days. After 16 weeks of treatment with adalimumab, Hurley staging was II, PGA IV, DLQI 3. The second male patient aged 28 years was referred to our Department with a shorter history: the first symptoms were presented as pilonidal sinus in 2012, after that in 2015 as inflamed nodules and fistulas in the axillary and inguinal regions. In 2018, physical examination showed the same nodules with a more intense character as well as furuncles on the scalp and skin of the back, with Hurley staging stage II, PGA staging III, DLQI 14 (Figure 3, Figure 4). Until the disease was diagnosed, the patient was treated several times with peroral antibiotics, while laboratory tests which included complete blood cell count, biochemistry, serology for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B and C infection together with chest X-rays were all within normal limits with the exception of elevated cholesterol (6.1). Abdominal ultrasound examination found no abnormalities. Quantiferon test was negative. The following therapy was administered during hospitalization: Humira (adalimumab) initial dose 160 mg, a dose of 80 mg after 14 days, and after 7 days 40 mg, in addition to local therapy with 10% resorcinol solution at the location of the skin changes. After 16 weeks of treatment with adalimumab, Hurley staging was II, PGA staging was III, and DLQI index was 3. Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic, recurrent inflammatory and debilitating skin disease of the terminal hair follicle that usually presents after puberty with painful, deep seated, inflamed lesions in the apocrine gland-bearing areas of the body, most commonly the axillary, inguinal, and anogenital region (3). Biological therapies have been increasingly used for patients who failed to sufficiently respond to antibiotics and hormonal treatments. Adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept have all been tested in the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa but vary in effectiveness and in how well they have been studied. Subcutaneous weekly adalimumab (160 mg at week, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg each week thereafter) is the only biologic agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) for the treatment of HS and is recommended as first-line therapy for patients who moderate-to-severe disease and who are intolerant or unresponsive to oral antibiotics (5,12). Treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa remains a considerable challenge and should be individualized according to the state and extent of the disease. Therapeutic options for hidradenitis suppurativa were long restricted to the use of local disinfectants and systemic antibiotics as well as repeated incisions and drainage, which produce only short-term benefits. Our patients showed regression of lesions after sixteen weeks of biological therapy."

The first symptoms had been unrecognized and presented as a pilonidal cyst 25 years ago as well as cysts on the intergluteal region treated with multiple surgical interventions and systemic antibiotics. The first hospitalization at our Department was in 2016. In addition to HS, the patient had diabetes mellitus (DM) type II and hypertension. A physical examination showed multiple abscesses, fistulas, and nodules in the axillary, inguinal, perianal, gluteal, and intergluteal regions; Hurley staging: stage II, PGA staging: IV, DLQI: 24 (Figure 1, Figure 2). Microbiological repeated swabs showed numerous bacteria such as Esch.coli, S.aureus, Serratia.spp, Enterococcus spp, St.epidermidis, and Proteus mirabilis. Laboratory tests which included complete blood cell count, biochemistry, serology for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B and C infection together with chest X-rays were all within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasound examination found no abnormalities. Quantiferon test was positive. After the monotherapy with isoniazid, a repeated Quantiferon test two months later was negative. The patient was treated with betadine solution and pus drainage until 2018, when at the Department of Dermatology and Venerology prescribed adalimumab in doses of 80 mg initially, 40 mg x2 on the first day and the day after that, then 80 mg after fifteen days followed by 40 mg every ten days. After 16 weeks of treatment with adalimumab, Hurley staging was II, PGA IV, DLQI 3. The second male patient aged 28 years was referred to our Department with a shorter history: the first symptoms were presented as pilonidal sinus in 2012, after that in 2015 as inflamed nodules and fistulas in the axillary and inguinal regions. In 2018, physical examination showed the same nodules with a more intense character as well as furuncles on the scalp and skin of the back, with Hurley staging stage II, PGA staging III, DLQI 14 (Figure 3, Figure 4). Until the disease was diagnosed, the patient was treated several times with peroral antibiotics, while laboratory tests which included complete blood cell count, biochemistry, serology for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B and C infection together with chest X-rays were all within normal limits with the exception of elevated cholesterol (6.1). Abdominal ultrasound examination found no abnormalities. Quantiferon test was negative. The following therapy was administered during hospitalization: Humira (adalimumab) initial dose 160 mg, a dose of 80 mg after 14 days, and after 7 days 40 mg, in addition to local therapy with 10% resorcinol solution at the location of the skin changes. After 16 weeks of treatment with adalimumab, Hurley staging was II, PGA staging was III, and DLQI index was 3. Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic, recurrent inflammatory and debilitating skin disease of the terminal hair follicle that usually presents after puberty with painful, deep seated, inflamed lesions in the apocrine gland-bearing areas of the body, most commonly the axillary, inguinal, and anogenital region (3). Biological therapies have been increasingly used for patients who failed to sufficiently respond to antibiotics and hormonal treatments. Adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept have all been tested in the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa but vary in effectiveness and in how well they have been studied. Subcutaneous weekly adalimumab (160 mg at week, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg each week thereafter) is the only biologic agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) for the treatment of HS and is recommended as first-line therapy for patients who moderate-to-severe disease and who are intolerant or unresponsive to oral antibiotics (5,12). Treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa remains a considerable challenge and should be individualized according to the state and extent of the disease. Therapeutic options for hidradenitis suppurativa were long restricted to the use of local disinfectants and systemic antibiotics as well as repeated incisions and drainage, which produce only short-term benefits. Our patients showed regression of lesions after sixteen weeks of biological therapy."

We employed the parametric G formula to analyze lung cancer mortality in a cohort of textile manufacturing workers who were occupationally exposed to asbestos in South Carolina. A total of 3,002 adults with a median age of 24 years at enrollment (58% male, 81% Caucasian) were followed for 117,471 person-years between 1940 and 2001, and 195 lung cancer deaths were observed. Chrysotile asbestos exposure was measured in fiber-years per milliliter of air, and annual occupational exposures were estimated on the basis of detailed work histories. Sixteen percent of person-years involved exposure to asbestos, with a median exposure of 3.30 fiber-years/mL among those exposed. Lung cancer mortality by age 90 years under the observed asbestos exposure was 9.44%. In comparison with observed asbestos exposure, if the facility had operated under the current Occupational Safety and Health Administration asbestos exposure standard of <0.1 fibers/mL, we estimate that the cohort would have experienced 24% less lung cancer mortality by age 90 years (mortality ratio = 0.76, 95% confidence interval: 0.62, 0.94). A further reduction in asbestos exposure to a standard of <0.05 fibers/mL was estimated to have resulted in a minimal additional reduction in lung cancer mortality by age 90 years (mortality ratio = 0.75, 95% confidence interval: 0.61, 0.92)."

Obesity rates increase as household income increases among Black men, yet only a few studies have sought to understand this unique association. Scholars have posited that gendered stressors like role strain that are work-related could play a role in obesity among Black men. Work-life interference is a concept that captures the conflict between work life and family/personal life. Work-life interference is associated with obesity-related behaviors but has been understudied in Black men. The aim of this study was to determine the interrelationship between work-life interference, income, and obesity among Black men. Using data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey, the associations between household income and odds of overweight and obesity (measured by body mass index) were assessed using ordinal logit regressions. Multiplicative interaction terms were used to assess the potential moderation of the association between income and log-odds of overweight/obesity by work-life interference. The results of our study demonstrate that work-life interference interacts with income >=400% federal poverty level (FPL) on the log-odds of overweight/obesity (beta=2.10, standard error [se]=.87). Among those who reported work-life interference, Black men who had household income >=400% FPL had higher log-odds of overweight/obesity (beta=1.51, se=.74) compared with those with income <100% FPL. There was no association between income and obesity among Black men who did not report work-life interference. The results suggest that work-life interference plays an important role in the positive association between income and obesity in Black men. Future studies should explicate the obesogenic ways in which work and family/personal life combine among high-income Black men."

Introduction: Globally, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and diabetes constitute over 50% of the noncommunicable disease (NCD) burden and projections indicate Sub-Saharan Africa will experience a larger burden. Urbanization on the continent is contributing to the change in lifestyle such as diet and physical activity, which may increase the risk for CVDs. There is lack of sufficient data from the African continent on hypertension and its association with sedentary lifestyle. Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study in periurban Uganda among adults aged at least 35 years. We administered questions on diet, physical activity, and smoking. We took anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose. Hypertension was defined as systolic BP > = 140 and/or diastolic BP > = 90 and/or history of hypertension medications. Logistic regression was used to determine the crude and adjusted odds ratios for the factors associated with hypertension. Results: We enrolled 310 participants and 50% were female. The prevalence of systolic hypertension was 24.5%, diastolic hypertension was 31%, obesity was 46%, and diabetes was 9%. Of those with hypertension (n = 76), 53 participants (69.7%) were not aware they had high BP. Sedentary lifestyle was significantly associated with hypertension even after adjusting for age and obesity. Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes and majority of participants with hypertension are not aware. Participants with a sedentary work style should be targeted for prevention and screening."

This study is intended to examine the prevalence of poor sleep quality in Chinese patients with CHD and its associations with anxiety and depression symptoms, and to explore whether sex, obesity and CHD type modify these associations. Three hundred and forty-eight participants were included. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI, >7 was defined as poor sleep quality) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were used to assess sleep quality and psychological symptoms. 47.1% of the participants had poor sleep quality. Logistic regression analysis showed that poor sleep quality was independently associated with anxiety and depression symptoms adjusting for demographic and clinical factors. However, adjusted for anxiety symptoms, poor sleep quality was no longer associated with depression symptoms. Subgroup and interaction analysis showed that poor sleep quality was associated with markedly higher HADS anxiety and depression scores among patients with stable angina than those with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). These findings suggest that poor sleep quality was associated with both anxiety and depression symptoms in Chinese patients with CHD.

BACKGROUND: About 35% of the cancer patients are involved in factors coming from the diet and others like alcohol, smoking, sunlight, chemical agents and infections caused by virus. The stomach cancer is the second cause of cancer in the world with 9.9 % of all diagnosis and about 12.1 % of death cases. AIMS: Evaluate the body weight, educational achievement, basic sanitation, smoking, alcoholism and eating habit among patients with gastric cancer and a control group. METHODS: Seventy patients with gastric cancer were paired with 70 subjects without cancer. Data on the weight and height, educational attainment, basic sanitation, smoking, alcoholism and eating habits of the patients were collected from the clinical records and from interviews. RESULTS: Forty two patients were men, the mean age were 60 years old. The actual weight and body mass index of the patients were smaller when compared to the controls. Within the group of patients with gastric cancer, 21 never attended school, and for those who attended, 55% did not finish the elementary school. Among the patient group, 32.9% of them lived in housing with basic sanitation and 37.1% with electricity, against 68.6% of the controls, and 58.6% of the patients lived in rural area, against only 7.1% of the controls. Among the test group, 65.7% of the patients were smokers, whereas in the control group, 44.3% were smokers. In addition, there was also difference in the duration of smoking habit. Alcoholism was also more frequent in the cancer group (44% vs 19%). Food rich in salt, condiments, nitrates, saturated fat, complex carbohydrates, refined sugar and fried salted food had been more used by gastric cancer patients. CONCLUSION: The patients with gastric cancer presented with: less weight, low quality of life as indicated by lower or no access to basic sanitation, electricity and schooling, lived predominantly in rural area, high incidence of alcohol intake and higher intake of high fat foods and industrialized foods."

INTRODUCTION: Apart from the association with tobacco consumption, other factors of importance for prevention and early diagnosis of lung cancer have received little attention. We present a case-control study focusing on professional exposure to carcinogens and social status. METHODS: A written questionnaire was completed by 551 consecutive patients with lung cancer and 494 patients with large bowel cancer. The groups were balanced regarding gender and age distribution. The questionnaire included data on place of birth, education, smoking history, diet and alcohol intake, body weight and height, occupation, housing conditions and family income. According to standard epidemiological criteria, professional exposure to carcinogens was classified as professions with exposure to confirmed lung cancer carcinogens, professions with exposure to suspected lung cancer carcinogens and other professions. RESULTS: As expected, there were significant differences between the two groups regarding smoking status. While there were no significant differences in educational levels, more immigrants were among patients with lung cancer (17.9% vs 11.6%, p=0.005). On average, lung cancer patients had a lower body mass index (BMI) at 24.77, as compared to 26.14 for large bowel cancer (p=0.000). Lung cancer patients had lower income and poorer housing conditions; the bivariate difference was significant both for income levels (p=0.046) and type of residence (p=0.009). The proportion of patients working in professions with exposures to known carcinogens was 33.5% for lung cancer, and 17.1% for large bowel cancer (p=0.000). In the multivariate analysis, smoking (p=0.000), BMI (p=0.000) and type of occupation (p=0.001) were significant factors. CONCLUSIONS: While there is no doubt about smoking in lung cancer carcinogenesis, professional exposure to carcinogens and belonging to lower socio-economic strata also play an important role."

We present a case-control study focusing on professional exposure to carcinogens and social status. METHODS: A written questionnaire was completed by 551 consecutive patients with lung cancer and 494 patients with large bowel cancer. The groups were balanced regarding gender and age distribution. The questionnaire included data on place of birth, education, smoking history, diet and alcohol intake, body weight and height, occupation, housing conditions and family income. According to standard epidemiological criteria, professional exposure to carcinogens was classified as professions with exposure to confirmed lung cancer carcinogens, professions with exposure to suspected lung cancer carcinogens and other professions. RESULTS: As expected, there were significant differences between the two groups regarding smoking status. While there were no significant differences in educational levels, more immigrants were among patients with lung cancer (17.9% vs 11.6%, p=0.005). On average, lung cancer patients had a lower body mass index (BMI) at 24.77, as compared to 26.14 for large bowel cancer (p=0.000). Lung cancer patients had lower income and poorer housing conditions; the bivariate difference was significant both for income levels (p=0.046) and type of residence (p=0.009). The proportion of patients working in professions with exposures to known carcinogens was 33.5% for lung cancer, and 17.1% for large bowel cancer (p=0.000). In the multivariate analysis, smoking (p=0.000), BMI (p=0.000) and type of occupation (p=0.001) were significant factors. CONCLUSIONS: While there is no doubt about smoking in lung cancer carcinogenesis, professional exposure to carcinogens and belonging to lower socio-economic strata also play an important role."

seizure	Cocaine	positive_statistical_association	26315001	train	T20	T19	2445:2452	2416:2423	"Cocaine use as an independent predictor of seizures after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
OBJECTIVE: Seizures are relatively common after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Seizure prophylaxis is controversial and is often based on risk stratification; middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms, associated intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), poor neurological grade, increased clot thickness, and cerebral infarction are considered highest risk for seizures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of recent cocaine use on seizure incidence following aSAH. METHODS: Prospectively collected data from aSAH patients admitted to 2 institutional neuroscience critical care units between 1991 and 2009 were reviewed. The authors analyzed factors that potentially affected the incidence of seizures, including patient demographic characteristics, poor clinical grade (Hunt and Hess Grade IV or V), medical comorbidities, associated ICH, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), hydrocephalus, aneurysm location, surgical clipping and cocaine use. They further studied the impact of these factors on ""early"" and ""late"" seizures (defined, respectively, as occurring before and after clipping/coiling). RESULTS: Of 1134 aSAH patients studied, 182 (16%) had seizures; 81 patients (7.1%) had early and 127 (11.2%) late seizures, with 26 having both. The seizure rate was significantly higher in cocaine users (37 [26%] of 142 patients) than in non-cocaine users (151 [15.2%] of 992 patients, p = 0.001). Eighteen cocaine-positive patients (12.7%) had early seizures compared with 6.6% of cocaine-negative patients (p = 0.003); 27 cocaine users (19%) had late seizures compared with 10.5% non-cocaine users (p = 0.001). Factors that showed a significant association with increased risk for seizure (early or late) on univariate analysis included younger age (< 40 years) (p = 0.009), poor clinical grade (p = 0.029), associated ICH (p = 0.007), and MCA aneurysm location (p < 0.001); surgical clipping was associated with late seizures (p = 0.004). Following multivariate analysis, age < 40 years (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.355-3.058, p = 0.001), poor clinical grade (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.124-2.336, p = 0.01), ICH (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.164-3.273, p = 0.011), MCA aneurysm location (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.237-4.854, p < 0.001), and cocaine use (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.330-3.175, p = 0.001) independently predicted seizures. CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine use confers a higher seizure risk following aSAH and should be considered during risk stratification for seizure prophylaxis and close neuromonitoring."

BACKGROUND: Dry eye disease is one of the most common public health problems in the field of ophthalmology that causes decreased physical, psychological, social and occupational functioning, and interferes with daily activities like reading, driving, computer work and watching TV. The effect of this disease on quality of life is similar to severe migraine and angina. In addition, the severity of the disease is closely related to depression. Outbreaks are increasing with the use of contact lenses and refractive surgery such as LASIK. The purpose of this paper is to assess the causes of dry eye and its prevention by the principles of hygiene. METHODS: In this review study, traditional medicine resources like Al canon fil tibb, Sharh-al-Al Asbab and Exir-e-azam have been studied with engine motors such as Google Scholar and PubMed. RESULTS: From the perspective of Iranian traditional medicine, the principles of maintaining health include air, food and drink, exercise and rest, sleep and wakefulness, mental state, retention of essential materials and depletion of wastes from the body. Proper performance of each principle is useful for the prevention of disease in different organs, including the eyes. Recommendations for the prevention or treatment of dry eye disease include the prevention of dryness in the eye or the entire body. In addition, the stomach and brain are important to eye health. Accordingly, one of the most effective managements of dry eye disease is avoiding foods that affect the eye in this way; for example garlic and onion. CONCLUSION: Maintaining eye health is related to aspects of physical and mental health of the whole body. Therefore, codification of an integrated plan that contains eating and sleeping patterns, exercise, general clearing, eye clearing, and mental health is essential for treating dry eye disease."

BACKGROUND: Dry eye disease is one of the most common public health problems in the field of ophthalmology that causes decreased physical, psychological, social and occupational functioning, and interferes with daily activities like reading, driving, computer work and watching TV. The effect of this disease on quality of life is similar to severe migraine and angina. In addition, the severity of the disease is closely related to depression. Outbreaks are increasing with the use of contact lenses and refractive surgery such as LASIK. The purpose of this paper is to assess the causes of dry eye and its prevention by the principles of hygiene. METHODS: In this review study, traditional medicine resources like Al canon fil tibb, Sharh-al-Al Asbab and Exir-e-azam have been studied with engine motors such as Google Scholar and PubMed. RESULTS: From the perspective of Iranian traditional medicine, the principles of maintaining health include air, food and drink, exercise and rest, sleep and wakefulness, mental state, retention of essential materials and depletion of wastes from the body. Proper performance of each principle is useful for the prevention of disease in different organs, including the eyes.

Analgesia	morphine	Causes	5531341	train	T18	T19	1443:1452	1464:1472	"The effect of thyroid hormones on the action of some centrally acting drugs. 
1. The effect of administration of thyroxine or thyroidectomy on the pharmacological action of (+)-amphetamine, caffeine, hexobarbitone and morphine was determined in rats or mice.2. Locomotor activity induced by (+)-amphetamine or caffeine was increased by hyperthyroidism and decreased by hypothyroidism.3. The LD50s of (+)-amphetamine and caffeine in hyperthyroid rats were 1/30 and 2/5 that of control rats. With each drug, the LD50 regression lines in hyperthyroid and control rats were not parallel, suggesting that hyperthyroidism modifies the mechanism of the toxic effects. Hypothyroidism reduced toxicity to (+)-amphetamine.4. Hexobarbitone sleeping time was prolonged in hyperthyroid male rats, but was shortened in hyperthyroid female rats. In control rats, sleeping time was approximately four times as long in females as it was in males. Ethinyloestradiol treatment and castration also prolonged sleeping time in male rats. No further prolongation was produced by combined administration of thyroxine and ethinyloestradiol, but thyroxine further prolonged the sleeping time of castrated rats indicating that its mode of action in producing these changes is not mediated via sex hormones.5. In contrast to rats, a sex difference in the duration of action of hexobarbitone was not found in mice. Thyroxine prolonged sleeping time equally in each sex.6. Analgesia induced by morphine in mice was unaffected by hyperthyroidism. No increase in sedative or ;Straub tail' activity could be detected, but toxicity was increased when higher doses of morphine were used.7. The mechanism by which thyroid hormones produce these changes in sensitivity to centrally acting drugs is discussed. It is suggested that the effects of thyroxine vary according to whether the mode of action of the drug or its metabolism is modified."

OBJECTIVES: The phytoestrogen (plant estrogen) genistein, present in soy products, is of interest because in utero exposure to genistein can cause hypospadias in our mouse model and maternal consumption of soy is prevalent in human populations. Another compound of interest is the fungicide vinclozolin, which also causes hypospadias in the mouse and rat and can occur concurrently with genistein in the diet as a residue on exposed foods. A study in the United Kingdom found no relationship between a maternal organic vegetarian diet and hypospadias frequency, but women who consumed nonorganic vegetarian diets had a greater percentage of sons with hypospadias. Because nonorganic diets can include residues of pesticides such as vinclozolin, we sought to assess the interaction of realistic daily exposures to genistein and vinclozolin and their effects on the incidence of hypospadias. METHODS: Pregnant mice were fed a soy-free diet and orally gavaged from gestational days 13 to 17 with 0.17 mg/kg/day of genistein, 10 mg/kg/day of vinclozolin, or genistein and vinclozolin together at the same doses, all in 100 microL of corn oil. The controls received the corn oil vehicle. The male fetuses were examined at gestational day 19 for hypospadias, both macroscopically and histologically. RESULTS: We identified no hypospadias in the corn oil group. The incidence of hypospadias was 25% with genistein alone, 42% with vinclozolin alone, and 41% with genistein and vinclozolin together. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the idea that exposure to these compounds during gestation could contribute to the development of hypospadias."

BACKGROUND: Early-life exposure to traffic-related air pollution exacerbates childhood asthma, but it is unclear what role it plays in asthma development. METHODS: The association between exposure to primary mobile source pollutants during pregnancy and during infancy and asthma incidence by ages 2 through 6 was examined in the Kaiser Air Pollution and Pediatric Asthma Study, a racially diverse birth cohort of 24,608 children born between 2000 and 2010 and insured by Kaiser Permanente Georgia. We estimated concentrations of mobile source fine particulate matter (PM2.5, microg/m), nitrogen oxides (NOX, ppb), and carbon monoxide (CO, ppm) at the maternal and child residence using a Research LINE source dispersion model for near-surface releases. Asthma was defined using diagnoses and medication dispensings from medical records. We used binomial generalized linear regression to model the impact of exposure continuously and by quintiles on asthma risk. RESULTS: Controlling for covariates and modeling log-transformed exposure, a 2.7-fold increase in first year of life PM2.5 was associated with an absolute 4.1% (95% confidence interval, 1.6%, 6.6%) increase in risk of asthma by age 5. Quintile analysis showed an increase in risk from the first to second quintile, but similar risk across quintiles 2-5. Risk differences increased with follow-up age.

arterial hypertension	alcohol consumption	positive_statistical_association	9813737	train	T9	T8	923:944	836:855	"[Pathogenesis and epidemiology of arterial hypertension]. 
The pathogenesis of arterial hypertension is more clearly understood today because of the availability of data enabling identification of a certain number of precipitating factors. From a genetic standpoint, hypertension would appear to be a multifactorial polygenic disorder with a tendency to interact with certain environmental factors. The latter are mainly related to lifestyle and are potentially modifiable. Obesity during childhood and adolescence is the main predictive factor for hypertension. It has been suggested that the underlying mechanism could well be hyperinsulinaemia, which induces hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. The mechanisms of the relationship between hypertension and alcohol are still unclear. However, in many countries, excessive alcohol consumption has been reported to be a significant factor in the development of arterial hypertension. The negative effect of a sedentary lifestyle on blood pressure has been widely demonstrated. In addition, it has also been shown that regular physical exercise under aerobic conditions leads to a reduction in blood pressure levels. An excessive sodium intake is also responsible for inducing arterial hypertension through increases in cardiac output and effects on vascular reactivity and contractility. Similarly, restricting sodium intake leads to a reduction in blood pressure levels. Smoking--namely, certain components of tobacco smoke--would appear to have both short and long term effects on blood pressure. These contributing factors all have specific effects on cardiac output and peripheral resistance in individuals. At the community level, the impact of hypertension is particularly significant. Prevalence is strongly influenced by the type of population studied, although it is generally estimated that this disease affects between 10 and 20% of the adult population and is responsible for 5.8% of all deaths worldwide. The direct and indirect costs of the disease are particularly high and are generally considered to be underestimated since a significant proportion of cardiac disease and stroke should also be included in any cost estimates, giving extremely high final figures. Hypertension-related morbidity and mortality principally result from cardiovascular complications and approximately 35% of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events can be attributed to hypertension. The highest risks are associated with stroke (relative risk: 3.8) and congestive heart failure in individuals with hypertension, in whom the risk is quadrupled. With regard to risk for an individual, the higher the blood pressure the greater the risk for the patient. However, the situation is very different if the entire population is being considered. In this instance, the highest risk is associated with mild hypertension since this involves the largest proportion of the hypertensive population. Similarly, relative risk corresponds to a probability rate that applies to populations rather than individuals. In response to this contradiction, the concept of absolute risk was proposed and corresponds to the prevalence of the disease. The approach to hypertension treatment based on absolute risk has recently been proposed for use in clinical practice.

arterial hypertension	sodium intake	Causes	9813737	train	T13	T12	1238:1259	1191:1204	"[Pathogenesis and epidemiology of arterial hypertension]. 
The pathogenesis of arterial hypertension is more clearly understood today because of the availability of data enabling identification of a certain number of precipitating factors. From a genetic standpoint, hypertension would appear to be a multifactorial polygenic disorder with a tendency to interact with certain environmental factors. The latter are mainly related to lifestyle and are potentially modifiable. Obesity during childhood and adolescence is the main predictive factor for hypertension. It has been suggested that the underlying mechanism could well be hyperinsulinaemia, which induces hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. The mechanisms of the relationship between hypertension and alcohol are still unclear. However, in many countries, excessive alcohol consumption has been reported to be a significant factor in the development of arterial hypertension. The negative effect of a sedentary lifestyle on blood pressure has been widely demonstrated. In addition, it has also been shown that regular physical exercise under aerobic conditions leads to a reduction in blood pressure levels. An excessive sodium intake is also responsible for inducing arterial hypertension through increases in cardiac output and effects on vascular reactivity and contractility. Similarly, restricting sodium intake leads to a reduction in blood pressure levels. Smoking--namely, certain components of tobacco smoke--would appear to have both short and long term effects on blood pressure. These contributing factors all have specific effects on cardiac output and peripheral resistance in individuals. At the community level, the impact of hypertension is particularly significant. Prevalence is strongly influenced by the type of population studied, although it is generally estimated that this disease affects between 10 and 20% of the adult population and is responsible for 5.8% of all deaths worldwide.

Each family of variables was reduced to a set of best predictors, and multivariate log binomial regression was used to identify the predictors of unemployment. RESULTS: Unemployment was more likely among those who experienced HIV/AIDS-related illness, scored higher on the Kessler scale of psychological distress and were older. There was a lower likelihood of unemployment among those who had better self-rated health, had been living with HIV/AIDS for a shorter period and who had a tertiary education.

The aim of the study was to analyze hand hygiene behaviors in a national representative sample of Polish adolescents in regions stratified by COVID-19 morbidity, while taking socioeconomic status of the region, as well rural or urban environment, into account as possible interfering factors. The study was conducted Polish Adolescents' COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study population (n = 2323) that was recruited based on a random sampling of schools, while the pair-matching procedure was applied within schools and age, in order to obtain adequate number of boys and girls, representative for the general Polish population (n = 1222). The participants were asked about their handwashing habits while using Handwashing Habits Questionnaire (HHQ) and about applied procedure of washing hands. The results were compared in subgroups that were stratified by region for COVID-19 morbidity, socioeconomic status of the region, and rural/urban environment. In regions of low COVID-19 morbidity, a higher share of adolescents, than in regions of high morbidity, declared washing their hands before meals (p = 0.0196), after meals (p = 0.0041), after preparing meals (p = 0.0297), before using the restroom (p = 0.0068), after using the restroom (p = 0.0014), after combing their hair (p = 0.0298), after handshaking (p = 0.0373), after touching animals (p = 0.0007), after contacting babies (p = 0.0278), after blowing nose (p = 0.0435), after touching sick people (p = 0.0351), and after cleaning home (p = 0.0234). For the assessed steps of the handwashing procedure, in regions of low COVID-19 morbidity, a higher share of adolescents included them to their daily handwashing, than in regions of high morbidity, that was stated for removing watch and bracelets (p = 0.0052), removing rings (p = 0.0318), and drying hands with towel (p = 0.0031). For the comparison in regions stratified by Gross Domestic Product, the differences were only minor and inconsistent. For the comparison in place of residence stratified by number of residents in city, there were some minor differences indicating better hand hygiene behaviors in the case of villages and small towns when compared with medium and large cities (p < 0.05). It may be concluded that, in a population-based sample of Polish adolescents, individuals from regions of low COVID-19 morbidity presented more beneficial hand hygiene habits than those from regions of high COVID-19 morbidity."
Asthma	air pollution	positive_statistical_association	29551329	train	T20	T22	1252:1258	1510:1523	"Air Quality Awareness Among U.S. Adults With Respiratory and Heart Disease. 
INTRODUCTION: Poor air quality affects respiratory and cardiovascular health. Information about health risks associated with outdoor air quality is communicated to the public using air quality alerts. This study was conducted to assess associations of existing respiratory and heart disease with three aspects of air quality awareness: awareness of air quality alerts, discussing with a health professional strategies to reduce air pollution exposure, and avoiding busy roads to reduce air pollution exposure when walking, biking, or exercising outdoors. METHODS: During 2014-2016, a total of 12,599 U.S. adults participated in summer waves of the ConsumerStyles surveys and self-reported asthma, emphysema/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, and each aspect of air quality awareness. In 2017, associations between each health condition and air quality awareness were estimated using log binomial and multinomial regression. RESULTS: Overall, 49% of respondents were aware of air quality alerts, 3% discussed with a health professional strategies to reduce air pollution exposure, and 27% always/usually avoided busy roads to reduce air pollution exposure. Asthma was associated with increased prevalence of awareness of air quality alerts (prevalence ratio=1.11, 95% CI=1.04, 1.20), discussing with a health professional (prevalence ratio=4.88, 95% CI=3.74, 6.37), and always/usually avoiding busy roads to reduce air pollution exposure (prevalence ratio=1.13, 95% CI=1.01, 1.27). Heart disease was not associated with air quality awareness. CONCLUSIONS: Existing respiratory disease, but not heart disease, was associated with increased air quality awareness. These findings reveal important opportunities to raise awareness of air quality alerts and behavior changes aimed at reducing air pollution exposure among adults at risk of exacerbating respiratory and heart diseases."

We conducted a systematic review of the literature exploring polysomnographic differences between narcolepsy patients and healthy controls (HCs) in EMBASE, MEDLINE, All EBM databases, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. 108 studies were identified for this review, 105 of which were used for meta-analysis. Meta-analyses revealed significant reductions in sleep latency, sleep efficiency, slow wave sleep percentage, rapid eye movement sleep (REM) latency, cyclic alternating pattern rate, and increases in total sleep time, wake time after sleep onset (WASO), awakening numbers (AWN) per hour, stage shift (SS) per hour, N1 percentage, apnea hypopnea index, and periodic limb movement index in narcolepsy patients compared with HCs. Furthermore, narcolepsy type 1 patients showed more disturbed nighttime sleep compared with narcolepsy type 2 patients. Children and adolescent narcolepsy patients show increased WASO, AWN, and SS compared with adult patients. Macro- and micro-structurally, our study suggests that narcolepsy patients have poor nighttime sleep.

BACKGROUND: The impact of impaired vision on cognitive and psychosocial outcomes among long-term survivors of childhood low-grade gliomas has not been investigated previously but could inform therapeutic decision making. METHODS: Data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study were used to investigate psychological outcomes (measures of cognitive/emotional function) and socioeconomic outcomes (education, income, employment, marital status, and independent living) among astroglial tumor survivors grouped by 1) vision without impairment, 2) vision with impairment (including unilateral blindness, visual field deficits, and amblyopia), or 3) bilateral blindness. The effect of vision status on outcomes was examined with multivariate logistic regression with adjustments for age, sex, cranial radiation therapy, and medical comorbidities. RESULTS: Among 1233 survivors of childhood astroglial tumors 5 or more years after their diagnosis, 277 (22.5%) had visual impairment. In a multivariate analysis, survivors with bilateral blindness were more likely to be unmarried (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 4.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-15.0), live with a caregiver (adjusted OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.3-7.5), and be unemployed (adjusted OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.5) in comparison with those without visual impairment.

BACKGROUND: The impact of impaired vision on cognitive and psychosocial outcomes among long-term survivors of childhood low-grade gliomas has not been investigated previously but could inform therapeutic decision making. METHODS: Data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study were used to investigate psychological outcomes (measures of cognitive/emotional function) and socioeconomic outcomes (education, income, employment, marital status, and independent living) among astroglial tumor survivors grouped by 1) vision without impairment, 2) vision with impairment (including unilateral blindness, visual field deficits, and amblyopia), or 3) bilateral blindness. The effect of vision status on outcomes was examined with multivariate logistic regression with adjustments for age, sex, cranial radiation therapy, and medical comorbidities. RESULTS: Among 1233 survivors of childhood astroglial tumors 5 or more years after their diagnosis, 277 (22.5%) had visual impairment. In a multivariate analysis, survivors with bilateral blindness were more likely to be unmarried (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 4.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-15.0), live with a caregiver (adjusted OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.3-7.5), and be unemployed (adjusted OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.5) in comparison with those without visual impairment.

asthma	Vitamin D supplementation	Controls	29936100	train	T2	T1	37:43	0:25	"Vitamin D supplementation attenuates asthma development following traffic-related particulate matter exposure. 
BACKGROUND: Recent literature suggests that children who are vitamin D deficient are uniquely susceptible to the effects of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) exposure. This is highly significant because large segments of the population reside in zones of high TRAP exposure. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether vitamin D supplementation mitigates the effect of TRAP exposure on asthma development, asthma exacerbation, and/or airway inflammation and to determine the timing of vitamin D supplementation that confers maximal health benefit. METHODS: Using established mouse models of asthma, we examined the effect of prenatal and postnatal vitamin D supplementation on asthma development, as well as the utility of vitamin D as a treatment for established asthma in the context of diesel exhaust particle (DEP) exposure. RESULTS: DEP and allergen coexposure resulted in increased airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and accumulation of pathogenic TH2/TH17 cells in the lungs of vitamin D-deficient mice compared with control mice. Prenatal and postnatal vitamin D supplementation significantly attenuated the development of AHR and decreased pulmonary accumulation of TH2/TH17 cells after coexposure to TRAP and allergen but not to allergen alone. Restoration of normal vitamin D status had no effect on AHR once asthma was already established. CONCLUSIONS: Our data establish that vitamin D confers protection against asthma development specifically in the context of TRAP exposure. Although vitamin D replacement did not reverse established asthma, restoration of normal vitamin D status in early life significantly attenuated the development of AHR in the setting of DEP-exacerbated allergic asthma and reduced numbers of lung TH2/TH17 cells, which portend the development of severe asthma."

Objective Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic disease of the bones. Osteoporosis reduces bone density, predisposes a person to fractures, and imposes high costs on societies. Osteoporosis develops from a variety of causes, one of the most significant is vitamin D deficiency. This study investigates the impact of vitamin D on osteoporosis. Materials and Methods In this clinical trial, 400 patients referred to the Bone Density Clinic of Kowsar Hospital in Semnan were selected by convenience sampling method. Bone densitometry tests were carried out using DEXA (x-ray absorptiometry) and serum vitamin D levels were measured by the ELISA method. Subjects with vitamin D deficiency were treated for 8 weeks with (50,000 Vitamin D units per week. At the end of the treatment period, all subjects were evaluated for bone density and the results of both groups were compared. Results 13% of subjects had osteoporosis and 14.2% had osteopenia. 19% of subjects had vitamin D deficiency, 38.8% had insufficient levels of vitamin D, and 42.3% had sufficient vitamin D levels.

Therapy consisted of 20 sessions over a minimum of 20 weeks. RESULTS: For the total study group (intent-to-treat group), there were significant differences among therapies in the primary global outcome measure. Nonspecific supportive clinical management was superior to interpersonal psychotherapy, while cognitive behavior therapy was intermediate, neither worse than nonspecific supportive clinical management nor better than interpersonal psychotherapy. For the women completing therapy, nonspecific supportive clinical management was superior to the two specialized therapies. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that nonspecific supportive clinical management was superior to more specialized psychotherapies was opposite to the primary hypothesis and challenges assumptions about the effective ingredients of successful treatments for anorexia nervosa."

BACKGROUND: COVID-19-related information on social media is overabundant and sometimes questionable, resulting in an ""infodemic"" during the pandemic. While previous studies suggest social media usage increases the risk of developing anxiety symptoms, how induced anxiety affects attitudes and behaviors is less discussed, let alone during a global pandemic. Little is known about the relationship between older adults using social media during a pandemic and their anxiety, their attitudes toward social trust in information, and behaviors to avoid contracting COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the associations between using social media for COVID-19-related information and anxiety symptoms as well as the mediation effect of anxiety symptoms on social trust in information and COVID-safe behaviors among older adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted in Hong Kong between May and August 2020. A rapid warm-call protocol was developed to train social workers and volunteers from participant nongovernmental organizations to conduct the telephone surveys. Questions related to COVID-safe behaviors, social trust in information, social media use, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and sociodemographic information were asked. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at the community level was used to account for the risk of contracting COVID-19. Ordinary least squares regressions examined the associations between social media use and anxiety symptoms, and how they were associated with social trust in information and COVID-safe behaviors. Structural equation modeling further mapped out these relationships to identify the mediation effects of anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: This study collected information regarding 3421 adults aged 60 years and older. Use of social media for COVID-19-related information was associated with more anxiety symptoms and lower social trust in information but had no significant relationship with COVID-safe behaviors. Anxiety symptoms predicted lower social trust in information and higher COVID-safe behaviors. Lower social trust in information was predicted by using social media for COVID-19 information, mediated by anxiety symptoms, while no mediation effect was found for COVID-safe behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults who rely on social media for COVID-19-related information exhibited more anxiety symptoms, while showing mixed effects on attitudes and behaviors. Social trust in information may be challenged by unverified and contradictory information online. The negligible impact on COVID-safe behaviors suggested that social media may have caused more confusion than consolidating a consistent effort against the pandemic. Media literacy education is recommended to promote critical evaluation of COVID-19-related information and responsible sharing among older adults."

Tobacco smoking is inconsistently associated with breast cancer. Although some studies suggest that breast cancer risk is related to passive smoking, little is known about the association with breast cancer by tumor hormone receptor status. We aimed to explore the association between lifetime passive smoking and risk of breast cancer subtypes defined by estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status among non-smoking Caucasian women. A hospital-based case-control study was performed in 585 cases and 1170 controls aged 28-90 years. Information on lifetime passive smoking and other factors was collected via a self-administered questionnaire. Logistic regression was used for analyses restricted to the 449 cases and 930 controls who had never smoked actively. All statistical tests were two-sided. Adjusted odds ratio of breast cancer was 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72-1.41) in women who experienced exposure to passive smoking at work, 1.88 (95% CI: 1.38-2.55) in women who had exposure at home, and 2.80 (95% CI: 1.84-4.25) in women who were exposed at home and at work, all compared with never exposed regularly. Increased risk was associated with longer exposure: women exposed <= 20 years and > 20 years had 1.27 (95% CI: 0.97-1.66) and 2.64 (95% CI: 1.87-3.74) times higher risk of breast cancer compared with never exposed (Ptrend < 0.001). The association of passive smoking with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer did not differ from that with hormone receptor-negative breast cancer (Pheterogeneity > 0.05). There was evidence of interaction between passive smoking intensity and menopausal status in both overall group (P = 0.02) and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer group (P < 0.05). In Caucasian women, lifetime exposure to passive smoking is associated with the risk of breast cancer independent of tumor hormone receptor status with the strongest association in postmenopausal women."

PURPOSE: To examine associations between knowledge of health conditions and sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake among Hispanic adults. DESIGN: Quantitative, cross-sectional study. SETTING: The 2015 Estilos survey data. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand US Hispanic adults (>=18 years). MEASURES: The outcome variable was frequency of SSB intake (regular soda, fruit drink, sports/energy drink, and sweetened coffee/tea drink). Exposure variables were knowledge of 6 SSB-related health conditions (weight gain, diabetes, dental caries, high cholesterol, heart disease, and hypertension). ANALYSIS: Six multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios for consuming SSBs >=3 times/day (high intake), in relation to knowledge of SSB-related health conditions. RESULTS: Overall, 58% of Hispanic adults consumed SSBs >=2 times/day and 36% consumed SSBs >=3 times/day. Although most identified that weight gain (75%) and diabetes (76%) were related to drinking SSBs, only half identified this relation with dental caries (57%) and hypertension (41%).

In crude analyses, SSB intake was significantly associated with knowledge of the associations between SSBs and weight gain, dental caries, and heart disease; however, after adjusting for sociodemographics and acculturation, associations were no longer significant.

BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) practice has been inversely associated to body fat (BF) and recommended as a way to reduce and prevent obesity. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the association of PA and BF in adolescence. METHODS: The review includes 18 longitudinal studies found in the PubMed database, comprising papers published from January 1990 to July 2014. Studies assessing BF only through body mass index were excluded. RESULTS: Among the outcomes analyzed, waist circumference, skinfolds, and absolute and relative fat mass measurement were identified. Questionnaires were the more predominant way to evaluate PA. Most studies showed that PA promotes a protective effect against a higher BF gain. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that PA has a protective effect against BF with differences between the genders and according to the BF marker or measurement assessed; higher intensity PA leads to a greater effect against BF gain in both genders; and the maintenance or increase of PA level on BF observed through analysis of change in PA level yielded more consistent findings in the relation between PA and BF."

BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) practice has been inversely associated to body fat (BF) and recommended as a way to reduce and prevent obesity. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the association of PA and BF in adolescence. METHODS: The review includes 18 longitudinal studies found in the PubMed database, comprising papers published from January 1990 to July 2014. Studies assessing BF only through body mass index were excluded. RESULTS: Among the outcomes analyzed, waist circumference, skinfolds, and absolute and relative fat mass measurement were identified. Questionnaires were the more predominant way to evaluate PA. Most studies showed that PA promotes a protective effect against a higher BF gain. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that PA has a protective effect against BF with differences between the genders and according to the BF marker or measurement assessed; higher intensity PA leads to a greater effect against BF gain in both genders; and the maintenance or increase of PA level on BF observed through analysis of change in PA level yielded more consistent findings in the relation between PA and BF."

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbroke in 2003, and the avian influenza A (H5N1) also outbroke in 2003 and continued to 2004. These pandemic viral diseases originated in South East Asia. Many human and animal lives were lost. Economic damages due to the pandemics were also very large. The question arises of why did the pandemics originate from South East Asian areas. Human influenza A consists of many sub-types of coronaviruses including the SARS virus and the avian influenza (H5N1) that are all variants of RNA of avian coronavirus. Variants are formed during infection of a coronavirus through not only birds but also mammals, including human beings. There are hot spots where viral infection rates are accelerated among birds, mammals and human beings. Suspicious areas are in South East Asia, where living conditions of birds, mammals and human beings are so close that there are always risks of viral infection. When we see the living conditions of farmers in southern China, northern Vietnam, Laos and northern Myanmar, they commonly raise ducks/chickens with pigs sharing ponds into which they discharge household wastewater, including human excreta, and pig excreta that are significant carriers of viruses. Bird faeces are also key carriers of the viruses. In the ponds, they raise ducks and conduct fish culture. Other important players are migrating birds from North Asia, which are principal vectors of avian influenza viruses. There is an urgent necessity of improving human and ecological health in South East Asia to control viral infection among birds, mammals and human beings. We can hinder the vicious cycle of virus infection through water contamination in ponds by providing good human, pig and chicken sanitation. It is easy to provide good sanitation practices for human, pigs and chickens, introducing collection and treatment of excreta. Our modern water technology can find good solutions for the problem."

OBJECTIVES: We report the results of the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium prospective surveillance study from January 2004 to December 2009 in 33 pediatric intensive care units of 16 countries and the impact of being in a private vs. public hospital and the income country level on device-associated health care-associated infection rates. Additionally, we aim to compare these findings with the results of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network annual report to show the differences between developed and developing countries regarding device-associated health care-associated infection rates. PATIENTS: A prospective cohort, active device-associated health care-associated infection surveillance study was conducted on 23,700 patients in International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium pediatric intensive care units. METHODS: The protocol and methodology implemented were developed by International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium. Data collection was performed in the participating intensive care units. Data uploading and analyses were conducted at International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium headquarters on proprietary software. Device-associated health care-associated infection rates were recorded by applying Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network device-associated infection definitions, and the impact of being in a private vs. public hospital and the income country level on device-associated infection risk was evaluated. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Central line-associated bloodstream infection rates were similar in private, public, or academic hospitals (7.3 vs. 8.4 central line-associated bloodstream infection per 1,000 catheter-days [p < .35 vs. 8.2; p < .42]). Central line-associated bloodstream infection rates in lower middle-income countries were higher than low-income countries or upper middle-income countries (12.2 vs. 5.5 central line-associated bloodstream infections per 1,000 catheter-days [p < .02 vs. 7.0; p < .001]).

This ecological study examines the variations in diarrhoea-specific infant mortality rates among municipalities in the State of Ceara, north-east Brazil, using data from a community health workers' programme. Diarrhoea is the main cause of postneonatal deaths in Ceara, and diarrhoea mortality rates vary substantially among municipalities, from 7 to 50 per thousand live births. To determine the inter-relationships between potential predictors of diarrhoea-specific infant mortality, eleven variables were classified into proximate determinants (i.e. adequate weight gain and exclusive breast-feeding in first 4 months) and underlying determinants (i.e. health services and socioeconomic variables). The health services variables included percentage with prenatal care up-to-date, participation in growth monitoring and immunization up-to-date, while the socioeconomic factors included female illiteracy rate, per capita gross municipality product and percentage of households with low income, percentage of households with inadequate water supply and inadequate sanitation, and urbanization. Using linear regression analysis variables were included from each group to build regression models. The significant determinants of variability in diarrhoea-specific infant mortality between municipalities were prevalence of infants exclusively breast-feeding, percentage of infants with adequate weight gain, percentage of pregnant women with prenatal care up-to-date, female illiteracy rate and inadequate water supply. These findings suggest that community-based promotion of exclusive breast-feeding in the first 4 months and care-giving behaviours that prevent weight faltering, including weaning practices and feeding during and following diarrhoea episodes, may further reduce municipality-level diarrhoea-specific mortality. Primary heath care strategies addressing these two proximate determinants provide only a partial solution to reducing diarrhoeal disease mortality. Improvements in municipal health services (prenatal care) and socioeconomic status variables, including water supply and maternal education, can also contribute to reduction of infant mortality due to diarrhoea. These results may be used by government health officials to set priorities by considering not only the strength of the association between selected risk factors and diarrhoea mortality rates, but also the prevalence of the risk factors being considered at the municipality level. Finally, the methods used are applicable to other settings with community-based primary health care decentralized to the state or municipal level."

This ecological study examines the variations in diarrhoea-specific infant mortality rates among municipalities in the State of Ceara, north-east Brazil, using data from a community health workers' programme. Diarrhoea is the main cause of postneonatal deaths in Ceara, and diarrhoea mortality rates vary substantially among municipalities, from 7 to 50 per thousand live births. To determine the inter-relationships between potential predictors of diarrhoea-specific infant mortality, eleven variables were classified into proximate determinants (i.e. adequate weight gain and exclusive breast-feeding in first 4 months) and underlying determinants (i.e. health services and socioeconomic variables). The health services variables included percentage with prenatal care up-to-date, participation in growth monitoring and immunization up-to-date, while the socioeconomic factors included female illiteracy rate, per capita gross municipality product and percentage of households with low income, percentage of households with inadequate water supply and inadequate sanitation, and urbanization. Using linear regression analysis variables were included from each group to build regression models. The significant determinants of variability in diarrhoea-specific infant mortality between municipalities were prevalence of infants exclusively breast-feeding, percentage of infants with adequate weight gain, percentage of pregnant women with prenatal care up-to-date, female illiteracy rate and inadequate water supply. These findings suggest that community-based promotion of exclusive breast-feeding in the first 4 months and care-giving behaviours that prevent weight faltering, including weaning practices and feeding during and following diarrhoea episodes, may further reduce municipality-level diarrhoea-specific mortality. Primary heath care strategies addressing these two proximate determinants provide only a partial solution to reducing diarrhoeal disease mortality. Improvements in municipal health services (prenatal care) and socioeconomic status variables, including water supply and maternal education, can also contribute to reduction of infant mortality due to diarrhoea. These results may be used by government health officials to set priorities by considering not only the strength of the association between selected risk factors and diarrhoea mortality rates, but also the prevalence of the risk factors being considered at the municipality level. Finally, the methods used are applicable to other settings with community-based primary health care decentralized to the state or municipal level."

BACKGROUND: Indian Asian men residing in the United Kingdom have a higher prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia than do their European counterparts. This has been largely attributed to dietary deficiencies in cobalamin associated with vegetarianism among these Indian Asians. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to ascertain the prevalence of folate and cobalamin deficiencies and hyperhomocysteinemia in Bangladesh. DESIGN: Plasma concentrations of homocysteine, folate, and cobalamin and urinary concentrations of creatinine were assessed in 1650 adults in Bangladesh. RESULTS: The prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia (men: >11.4 micromol/L; women: >10.4 micromol/L) was markedly (P < 0.0001) greater among men (63%; x +/- SD: 15.3 +/- 9.5 micromol/L) than among women (26%; 9.5 +/- 4.7 micromol/L). Folate was lower (9.8 +/- 6.5 and 12.3 +/- 7.6 nmol/L, respectively), whereas cobalamin was higher (281 +/- 115 and 256 +/- 118 pmol/L, respectively) (P < 0.0001 for both) among men than among women. Folate explained 15% and cobalamin explained 5% of the variation in homocysteine concentrations. For men, folate (P = 0.005) and cobalamin (P = 0.03) were positively correlated with urinary creatinine. Smoking (P < 0.0003) and betelnut use (P < 0.0002) were independent negative predictors of folate. CONCLUSIONS: Bangladeshi men have a high prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia, which is more closely associated with folate than with cobalamin, although other factors, eg, smoking and betelnut use, may also contribute to its cause. The positive correlations between urinary creatinine and plasma folate and cobalamin were unanticipated and could suggest that, in marginal nutrition, these vitamins may be limiting for creatine biosynthesis."

BACKGROUND: Considerable research has been devoted to examining the mental health conditions of patients with COVID-19 and medical staff attending to these patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are few insights concerning how the pandemic may take a toll on the mental health of the general population, and especially of nonpatients (ie, individuals who have not contracted COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association between social media use and mental health conditions in the general population based on a national representative sample during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: We formed a national representative sample (N=2185) comprising participants from 30 provinces across China, who were the first to experience the COVID-19 outbreak in the world. We administered a web-based survey to these participants to analyze social media use, health information support received via social media, and possible psychiatric disorders, including secondary traumatic stress (STS) and vicarious trauma (VT). RESULTS: Social media use did not cause mental health issues, but it mediated the levels of traumatic emotions among nonpatients. Participants received health information support via social media, but excessive social media use led to elevated levels of stress (beta=.175; P<.001), anxiety (beta=.224; P<.001), depression (beta=.201; P<.001), STS (beta=.307; P<.001), and VT (beta=.688; P<.001). Geographic location (or geolocation) and lockdown conditions also contributed to more instances of traumatic disorders. Participants living in big cities were more stressed than those living in rural areas (P=.02). Furthermore, participants from small cities or towns were more anxious (P=.01), stressed (P<.001), and depressed (P=.008) than those from rural areas. Obtaining more informational support (beta=.165; P<.001) and emotional support (beta=.144; P<.001) via social media increased their VT levels. Peer support received via social media increased both VT (beta=.332; P<.001) and STS (beta=.130; P<.001) levels. Moreover, geolocation moderated the relationships between emotional support on social media and VT (F2=3.549; P=.029) and the association between peer support and STS (F2=5.059; P=.006). Geolocation also interacted with health information support in predicting STS (F2=5.093; P=.006). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has taken a severe toll on the mental health of the general population, including individuals who have no history of psychiatric disorders or coronavirus infection. This study contributes to the literature by establishing the association between social media use and psychiatric disorders among the general public during the COVID-19 outbreak. The study findings suggest that the causes of such psychiatric disorders are complex and multifactorial, and social media use is a potential factor. The findings also highlight the experiences of people in China and can help global citizens and health policymakers to mitigate the effects of psychiatric disorders during this and other public health crises, which should be regarded as a key component of a global pandemic response."

RESULTS: Social media use did not cause mental health issues, but it mediated the levels of traumatic emotions among nonpatients. Participants received health information support via social media, but excessive social media use led to elevated levels of stress (beta=.175; P<.001), anxiety (beta=.224; P<.001), depression (beta=.201; P<.001), STS (beta=.307; P<.001), and VT (beta=.688; P<.001). Geographic location (or geolocation) and lockdown conditions also contributed to more instances of traumatic disorders. Participants living in big cities were more stressed than those living in rural areas (P=.02). Furthermore, participants from small cities or towns were more anxious (P=.01), stressed (P<.001), and depressed (P=.008) than those from rural areas. Obtaining more informational support (beta=.165; P<.001) and emotional support (beta=.144; P<.001) via social media increased their VT levels. Peer support received via social media increased both VT (beta=.332; P<.001) and STS (beta=.130; P<.001) levels. Moreover, geolocation moderated the relationships between emotional support on social media and VT (F2=3.549; P=.029) and the association between peer support and STS (F2=5.059; P=.006). Geolocation also interacted with health information support in predicting STS (F2=5.093; P=.006). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has taken a severe toll on the mental health of the general population, including individuals who have no history of psychiatric disorders or coronavirus infection. This study contributes to the literature by establishing the association between social media use and psychiatric disorders among the general public during the COVID-19 outbreak. The study findings suggest that the causes of such psychiatric disorders are complex and multifactorial, and social media use is a potential factor. The findings also highlight the experiences of people in China and can help global citizens and health policymakers to mitigate the effects of psychiatric disorders during this and other public health crises, which should be regarded as a key component of a global pandemic response."

BACKGROUND: Considerable research has been devoted to examining the mental health conditions of patients with COVID-19 and medical staff attending to these patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are few insights concerning how the pandemic may take a toll on the mental health of the general population, and especially of nonpatients (ie, individuals who have not contracted COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association between social media use and mental health conditions in the general population based on a national representative sample during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: We formed a national representative sample (N=2185) comprising participants from 30 provinces across China, who were the first to experience the COVID-19 outbreak in the world. We administered a web-based survey to these participants to analyze social media use, health information support received via social media, and possible psychiatric disorders, including secondary traumatic stress (STS) and vicarious trauma (VT).

PURPOSE: The association of second hand smoke or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and periodontitis in non-smokers has not been confirmed using a biomarker of ETS exposure. To estimate periodontitis prevalence in non-smokers with detectable serum cotinine, and to investigate racial/ethnic and socioeconomic variation in ETS exposure in a representative sample of the U. S. adult population. Determining periodontitis risk indicators occurring with ETS appears to be a salient purpose as this study is the first of its kind to provide a link (a salivary biomarker) between second hand smoke and risk for periodontitis. METHODS: Data were collected from the 1999 to 2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Subjects were 3,137 adults who had smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes and had not used other forms of tobacco. ETS exposure was classified as negligible (cotinine concentrations below sex and race/ethnicity cut-points for smokers), moderate (cotinine 0.5-<1.5 mug/mL) or high (cotinine >= 1.5 ng/mL). Periodontitis was classified according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) case definition for moderate-severe disease. Survey estimation procedures were used to estimate prevalence and odds ratios (OR) were from multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: ETS exposure was observed in 40.5% of subjects and 2.6% had periodontitis. ETS exposure was inversely associated with educational attainment and family income and was higher in non-Hispanic blacks than whites. After adjusting for age, sex and year of survey, adults with high ETS exposure (cotinine >= 1.5 ng/mL) had more than twice the odds of periodontitis as people with negligible exposure (OR=2.3, 95% confidence interval=1.3, 4.1). CONCLUSION: High ETS exposure was a risk indicator for periodontitis in lifetime non-smokers."

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of dyslipidemia in students from the primary and middle schools and the influential factors, and to provide evidence for the prevention and control of dyslipidemia and relevant chronic diseases in primary and middle schools.   Methods: A total of 2 028 students aged 7 to 17 from the primary and middle schools in Changsha were selected by stratified random cluster sampling. The contents of the study included questionnaire survey, physical measurement and blood tests for fasting blood triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) level was calculated by TC level minus HDL-C level. Chi-square test and non-conditional logistic regression model were used to analyze the factors that contributed to dyslipidemia.  Results: The dyslipidemia rate was 18.6%, and the abnormal rates of TG, TC, LDL-C, non-HDL-C and HDL-C were 6.8%, 5.6%, 2.3%, 4.2% and 8.6%, respectively. By chi-square test, the dyslipidemia rate in students with different ages, home locations, BMI groups, central obesity, time on watching TV or playing computer per day, and daily sleep time was statistically significant. Non-conditional logistic regression analysis showed that home location for the city (OR=1.332), overweight (OR=1.548), obesity (OR=2.201), central obesity (OR=1.695), watching TV or playing computer for more than 2 hours per day (OR=1.357), daily sleep time longer than 11 hours (OR=2.518) were the risk factors for dyslipidemia in students from the primary and middle schools.

Quantifying the impact of different modifiable behavioral and biological risk factors on socioeconomic disparities in coronary heart disease (CHD) may help inform targeted, population-specific strategies to reduce the unequal distribution of the disease. Previous studies have used analytic approaches that limit our ability to disentangle the relative contributions of these risk factors to CHD disparities. The goal of this study was to assess mediation of the effect of low education on incident CHD by multiple risk factors simultaneously. Analyses are based on 15,067 participants of the Dutch Monitoring Project on Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases aged 20-65 years examined 1994-1997 and followed for events until January 1, 2008. Path analysis was used to quantify and test mediation of the low education-CHD association by behavioral (current cigarette smoking, heavy alcohol use, poor diet, and physical inactivity) and biological (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia) risk factors. Behavioral and biological risk factors accounted for 56.6 % (95 % CI 42.6-70.8 %) of the low education-incident CHD association. Smoking was the strongest mediator, accounting for 27.3 % (95 % CI 17.7-37.4 %) of the association, followed by obesity (10.2 %; 95 % CI 4.5-16.1 %), physical inactivity (6.3 %; 95 % CI 2.7-10.0 %), and hypertension (5.3 %; 95 % CI: 2.8-8.0 %). In summary, in a Dutch cohort, the majority of the relationship between low education and incident CHD was mediated by traditional behavioral and biological risk factors. Addressing barriers to smoking cessation, blood pressure and weight management, and physical activity may be the most effective approaches to eliminating socioeconomic inequalities in CHD."

Quantifying the impact of different modifiable behavioral and biological risk factors on socioeconomic disparities in coronary heart disease (CHD) may help inform targeted, population-specific strategies to reduce the unequal distribution of the disease. Previous studies have used analytic approaches that limit our ability to disentangle the relative contributions of these risk factors to CHD disparities. The goal of this study was to assess mediation of the effect of low education on incident CHD by multiple risk factors simultaneously. Analyses are based on 15,067 participants of the Dutch Monitoring Project on Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases aged 20-65 years examined 1994-1997 and followed for events until January 1, 2008. Path analysis was used to quantify and test mediation of the low education-CHD association by behavioral (current cigarette smoking, heavy alcohol use, poor diet, and physical inactivity) and biological (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia) risk factors. Behavioral and biological risk factors accounted for 56.6 % (95 % CI 42.6-70.8 %) of the low education-incident CHD association.

We prospectively examined physical activity in relation to breast cancer risk among 45,631 women participating in the U.S. Radiologic Technologists cohort. Participants provided information at baseline regarding hours spent per week engaging in strenuous activity, walking/hiking for exercise, and walking at home or work. We estimated multivariable relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of breast cancer using Cox regression. We identified 864 incident-invasive breast cancers.

BACKGROUND: Since 1995, epidemiologic studies of atopic disorders using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire have been performed in many countries, including the Republic of Korea. The prevalence, burden and risk factors of atopic dermatitis were surveyed in these studies, which helped to enhance their comparability among different areas and age groups, as well as to clarify the nature of atopic dermatitis and other atopic disorders. METHODS: From 21 facilities, 8,750 children were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The data were collected via the Internet using a questionnaire based on the Korean-language version of the ISAAC study format. RESULTS: The prevalence of atopic dermatitis over the previous 12 months was 14.4%. The prevalence in preschool children was significantly higher than in elementary school children. Family history of atopic diseases, diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis and diagnosis of food allergy were positively associated with atopic dermatitis in both preschool and elementary school children. In addition, raising pets was positively associated with atopic dermatitis in preschool children. In elementary school children, female gender, secondhand smoking, breastfeeding, changing the parents' house to a newly built one during the first year of life, diagnosis of asthma and diagnosis of allergic rhinitis were positively associated with atopic dermatitis. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of atopic dermatitis in preschool and elementary school children in Korea is similar to that of children in other developing countries.

Assuming immunodeficiency as the common denominator the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) termed the epidemic, AIDS, for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. From 1981-1984 leading researchers including those from the CDC proposed that recreational drug use was the cause of AIDS, because of exact correlations and of drug-specific diseases. However, in 1984 US government researchers proposed that a virus, now termed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the cause of the non-random epidemics of the US and Europe but also of a new, sexually random epidemic in Africa. The virus-AIDS hypothesis was instantly accepted, but it is burdened with numerous paradoxes, none of which could be resolved by 2003: Why is there no HIV in most AIDS patients, only antibodies against it? Why would HIV take 10 years from infection to AIDS? Why is AIDS not self-limiting via antiviral immunity? Why is there no vaccine against AIDS?

Why is the mortality of HIV-antibody-positives treated with anti-HIV drugs 7-9%, but that of all (mostly untreated) HIV-positives globally is only 1.4%? Here we propose that AIDS is a collection of chemical epidemics, caused by recreational drugs, anti-HIV drugs, and malnutrition. According to this hypothesis AIDS is not contagious, not immunogenic, not treatable by vaccines or antiviral drugs, and HIV is just a passenger virus.

BACKGROUND: As the link between agricultural pesticides and numerous types of human cancers is wellknown. Farmers living in the Province of Vercelli (Italy) were observed to verify if they have a higher cancer risk than the rest of the local employed population. Literature showed a well-known excess of cancer morbidity and mortality in the Province of Vercelli, but only few studies focused on cancer incidence in local farmers. Studying farmers could allow to assess the causal importance respectively of environmental pressure and professional exposure factors in explaining cancer excesses in the above-mentioned area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present ecological study considered all cancer new cases recorded among the mean employed population with a range of age from 25 to 84 years and resident in the Province of Vercelli during the four-year period 2002-2005. Cancer odds ratios, by gender and type of cancer, between farmers and non-farmers were calculated. RESULTS: Farmers showed a higher risk for the following tumors: colorectal (OR 2.38, IC95%: 1,76-2,87), leaukaemia (OR 2.65, IC95%:2,12-2,89), digestive system (OR 2.16, IC95% 1,92-2,33), lymphoma OR 2.08, IC95%:1,99-2,23), melanoma (OR 2.90, IC95%:2,54-3,15), myeloma OR 3.55, IC95%:3,23-3,70), pancreas OR 3.38, IC95%:3,14-3,61), lung (1.59, IC95%:1,12-2,38) and kidney (2.70, IC95%:2,41-2,99). Males showed a higher risk for lung cancer, females for liver neoplasm, melanoma and lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Farmers showed a higher risk for several cancers. Further studies are needed, in order to examine in detail the issue, to encourage the use of personal protective equipment and to promote a more responsible pesticides use."

The aims of the present study were to analyze the association between incident stroke, occupational class and stress and to examine whether the association is found in both men and women in a prospective study of Japanese male and female workers. A total of 3190 male and 3363 female Japanese community-dwelling workers aged 65 or under with no history of cardiovascular disease were followed. Occupational stress was evaluated using a demand-control questionnaire. The impact on stroke was examined in stratified analyses of occupational classes. We identified 147 incident strokes (91 in men and 56 in women) during the 11-year follow-up period. Men with high strain jobs (combination of high job demand and low job control) were nearly three times more likely to suffer from a stroke than men with low strain jobs (combination of low job demand and high job control). Among male workers in low occupational classes (blue-collar and non-managerial work), job strain was associated with a higher risk of stroke. In contrast, there was no association between job strain and incident stroke among male workers in high occupational classes (white-collar and managerial work). No statistically significant differences were found for stroke incidence among the job characteristic categories in all the female participants. However, significant, over five-fold excess risks were found among white-collar and managerial female workers exposed to high job strain, compared with their counterparts with low strain jobs.

The aims of the present study were to analyze the association between incident stroke, occupational class and stress and to examine whether the association is found in both men and women in a prospective study of Japanese male and female workers. A total of 3190 male and 3363 female Japanese community-dwelling workers aged 65 or under with no history of cardiovascular disease were followed. Occupational stress was evaluated using a demand-control questionnaire. The impact on stroke was examined in stratified analyses of occupational classes. We identified 147 incident strokes (91 in men and 56 in women) during the 11-year follow-up period. Men with high strain jobs (combination of high job demand and low job control) were nearly three times more likely to suffer from a stroke than men with low strain jobs (combination of low job demand and high job control). Among male workers in low occupational classes (blue-collar and non-managerial work), job strain was associated with a higher risk of stroke. In contrast, there was no association between job strain and incident stroke among male workers in high occupational classes (white-collar and managerial work). No statistically significant differences were found for stroke incidence among the job characteristic categories in all the female participants. However, significant, over five-fold excess risks were found among white-collar and managerial female workers exposed to high job strain, compared with their counterparts with low strain jobs. Our study of Japanese workers provided supportive evidence for vulnerability to occupational stress among lower occupational class workers in males but not in females."

A case-control comparison of lung cancer deaths versus deaths from all other cancers occurring in Alameda County, California, between 1958 and 1962 was conducted to investigate possible associations between lung cancer and occupation. Age-adjusted, sex-specific analyses indicated that a history of work in certain industries and occupations was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Among males, a significant positive association was found for glass, metal, furniture, professional and photographic equipment, rubber, leather and plastic manufacturing; water and air transportation; auto repair services; and construction. Specific occupations associated with a significant positive risk for males were: electricians, aircraft mechanics, painters, plasterers, machine operators, construction workers, bus and truck drivers, and guards and nightwatchmen. Among females, beauticians had a significantly high risk associated with lung cancer. These results were consistent with other studies of lung cancer related to occupation."

OBJECTIVE: The present study sought to determine whether the 12-session pre- to posttest therapeutic gains that had been found by Deblinger, Lippmann. and Steer (1996) for an initial sample of 100 sexually abused children suffering posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms would be sustained 2 years after treatment. METHOD: These sexually abused children, along with their nonoffending mothers, had been randomly assigned to one of three cognitive-behavioral treatment conditions, child only, mother only, or mother and child, or a community comparison condition, and were followed for 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after treatment. RESULTS: A series of repeated MANCOVAs, controlling for the pre-test scores, indicated that for the three measures of psychopathology that had significantly decreased in the original study (i.e., externalizing behavior problems, depression, and PTSD symptoms), these measures at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years were comparable to the posttest scores. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the pre- to post-treatment improvements held across the 2-year follow-up period. The clinical and research implications of these findings are discussed."

OBJECTIVE: Asthma prevalence and morbidity are disproportionately higher among youth with lower socioeconomic status (SES). Examination of subjective social status (SSS) may improve understanding of associations between SES and health outcomes in pediatric asthma. METHOD: Fifty adolescents with asthma (Mage = 13.2 years, SD = 1.23; 54% male; 55.1% African American) completed the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status-Youth Version, Daily Life Stressors Scale, Children's Depression Inventory-Short Form, Adolescent Sleep-Wake Scale-short version, and Asthma Control Test during the baseline visit of a study of health behaviors. Body mass index z scores (BMIz) were calculated using height and weight obtained during the visits. Hierarchical linear regressions examined associations between SSS and psychosocial and physical health outcomes, controlling for caregiver-reported objective SES. RESULTS: Caregiver-reported objective SES was not associated with adolescent SSS. SSS-society was associated with daily stress (b = -3.14), t(47) = -2.13, p = .033; asthma control (beta = .34, p = .045); BMIz (beta = .38, p = .013); and sleep quality (beta = .49, p = .001).

Mounting evidence suggests that air pollution contributes to the large global burden of respiratory and allergic diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, and possibly tuberculosis. Although associations between air pollution and respiratory disease are complex, recent epidemiologic studies have led to an increased recognition of the emerging importance of traffic-related air pollution in both developed and less-developed countries, as well as the continued importance of emissions from domestic fires burning biomass fuels, primarily in the less-developed world. Emissions from these sources lead to personal exposures to complex mixtures of air pollutants that change rapidly in space and time because of varying emission rates, distances from source, ventilation rates, and other factors. Although the high degree of variability in personal exposure to pollutants from these sources remains a challenge, newer methods for measuring and modeling these exposures are beginning to unravel complex associations with asthma and other respiratory tract diseases. These studies indicate that air pollution from these sources is a major preventable cause of increased incidence and exacerbation of respiratory disease. Physicians can help to reduce the risk of adverse respiratory effects of exposure to biomass and traffic air pollutants by promoting awareness and supporting individual and community-level interventions."

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome	normal sleep pattern	Prevents	11157583	train	T1	T31	146:178	305:325	"Daytime sleepiness and EEG spectral analysis in apneic patients before and after treatment with continuous positive airway pressure. 
BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by recurrent apneas during sleep, resulting in repetitive hypoxemic episodes and interruptions of the normal sleep pattern. A previous study showed EEG slowing (ie, a higher ratio of delta + theta frequencies to alpha + beta frequencies on EEG) during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and wakefulness in untreated OSAS patients. STUDY AND OBJECTIVES: To determine whether EEG slowing is reversible with continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) treatment and to verify whether the persistence of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is correlated with residual slowing of the EEG. PATIENTS: Ten healthy subjects (9 men and 1 woman) and 14 patients with moderate-to-severe OSAS (13 men and 1 woman) were studied before and after 6 months of treatment with CPAP. RESULTS: Untreated OSAS patients showed EEG slowing in frontal and central cortical regions during both wakefulness and during REM sleep compared to healthy control subjects. This EEG slowing was found to be independent of time spent with arterial oxygen saturation < 90%, severity of OSAS, or mean sleep latency as determined by the multiple sleep latency test. CPAP treatment was found to correct the EEG slowing for both REM sleep and wakefulness. Daytime sleepiness also greatly improved with treatment, but some degree of somnolence remained. CONCLUSION: CPAP treatment was found to correct the EEG slowing that was observed in untreated OSAS patients. Persistent EDS may be related to persistent obesity after CPAP treatment."
malaria	Vitamin A supplements	Treats	12055820	train	T6	T4	166:173	101:122	"Lack of influence of red palm oil on severity of malaria infection in pre-school Nigerian children. 
Vitamin A supplements are reported to reduce febrile episodes of malaria and parasite counts, especially in children aged 12-36 months. Red palm oil (RPO) is a good source of vitamin A, is rich in alpha- and beta-carotene and is as effective as high-dose retinyl palmitate supplements in improving vitamin A status. In western Nigeria, where malaria is endemic, RPO is widely used and consumption can be measured using plasma alpha-carotene as a proxy biomarker since there are few other prominent sources of this carotene in the diet. The influence of RPO consumption on malaria was investigated in 207 children (aged 0-60 months) who presented with fever in August-October 1999 at several hospital clinics around Ile-Ife. Medical and anthropometric data, body temperature, parasitaemia and plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), retinol, carotenoids and tocopherols were measured in the children. Mothers were interviewed on usage of cooking oil and mosquito nets in the home, education and occupation. Most families used RPO and median plasma concentrations of both alpha-carotene (0.518 mumol/L) and beta-carotene (0.698 mumol/L) in the children were high. Using body temperature, parasite density and plasma CRP as markers of disease severity, multiple linear regression analysis was carried out on those for whom complete data were available (n = 138), separated into 3 age-groups of < 12 months (n = 37), 12-36 months (n = 68) and > 36 months (n = 33). In the absence of plasma retinol, plasma alpha-carotene explained 13.9% of the variance in parasite density (P = 0.013) but only in children aged > 36 months. The relationship with disease severity was negative, i.e., there was some evidence that RPO usage protected against malaria, and other dietary indices generally indicated that better nutritional status was associated with a lower severity of malaria."

OBJECTIVES: To assess the sleep quality in primary Sjoegren's syndrome (pSS) patients and evaluate its relationship with the disease, quality of life and mood disorders. METHODS: The sleep quality of 29 pSS women and 29 matched controls was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Seven domains are grouped according to three factors: F1 perceived sleep quality (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, use of sleeping medication), F2 sleep efficiency (sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency) and F3 daily disturbances (sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction). These domains are scored as a single factor of global sleep quality. The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) fatigue scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were also administered. Disease activity and damage were evaluated with the EULAR Sjoegren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI), the Sjoegren's Syndrome Disease Activity and Damage Indexes (SSDAI, SSDDI). RESULTS: The mean PSQI global score had higher pathological values (8.6+/-4.6) compared with controls (5.6+/-2.2) (p=0.002). F1 and F3 were significantly worse in cases (p=0.01, p=0.009).

OBJECTIVES: The cholera outbreak in Yemen has become the largest in the recent history of cholera records, having reached more than 1.4 million cases since it started in late 2016. This study aimed to identify risk factors for cholera in this outbreak. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in Aden in 2018 to investigate risk factors for cholera in this still-ongoing outbreak. In total, 59 cholera cases and 118 community controls were studied. RESULTS: The following risk factors were associated with being a cholera case in the bivariate analysis: a history of travelling and having had visitors from outside Aden Province; eating outside the house; not washing fruit, vegetables, and khat (a local herbal stimulant) before consumption; using common-source water; and not using chlorine or soap in the household. In the multivariate analysis, not washing khat and the use of common-source water remained significant risk factors for being a cholera case.

OBJECTIVE: Problem and pathological gamblers are significantly more likely to experience mood disorders, compared with the general population. Our study examined the relation of psychological characteristics (personality, trait impulsiveness, and gambling motives) to current co-occurring mood disorder (major depression and dysthymia) status among problem and pathological gamblers. METHOD: Problem and pathological gamblers (N = 150) underwent a clinical interview to assess current co-occurring mood disorders; participants completed measures of problem gambling severity, personality, impulsiveness, and gambling motives. RESULTS: Problem and pathological gamblers with a current co-occurring mood disorder were more likely to be female, older, and to report higher lifetime and past-year gambling severity. A co-occurring mood disorder was associated with higher personality scores for alienation and stress reaction, lower scores for well-being, social closeness, and control, as well as higher impulsiveness scores for urgency and lack of premeditation, and lower sensation seeking scores. Participants with a co-occurring mood disorder also reported higher coping motives for gambling. Multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that personality factors (lower social closeness and higher alienation) contributed to the greatest likelihood of being diagnosed with a co-occurring mood disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Mood disorders frequently co-occur with problem and pathological gambling, and they are associated with greater gambling severity. These findings highlight that interpersonal facets of personality contribute substantially to co-occurring mood disorder status. Implications for treatment will be discussed."

CONTEXT: Research on predictors of clinical outcomes usually focuses on the impact of individual patient factors, despite known relationships between neighborhood environment and health. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether US census information on where a patient resides is associated with diabetes development among patients with prediabetes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of all 157,752 patients aged 18 years or older from Kaiser Permanente Northern California with laboratory-defined prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose, 100 mg/dL-125 mg/dL, and/or glycated hemoglobin, 5.7%-6.4%). We assessed whether census data on education, income, and percentage of households receiving benefits through the US Department of Agriculture's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) was associated with diabetes development using logistic regression controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, blood glucose levels, and body mass index. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Progression to diabetes within 36 months. RESULTS: Patients were more likely to progress to diabetes if they lived in an area where less than 16% of adults had obtained a bachelor's degree or higher (odds ratio [OR] =1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09-1.36), where median annual income was below $79,999 (OR = 1.16 95% CI = 1.03-1.31), or where SNAP benefits were received by 10% or more of households (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.1-1.4). CONCLUSION: Area-level socioeconomic and food assistance data predict the development of diabetes, even after adjusting for traditional individual demographic and clinical factors. Clinical interventions should take these factors into account, and health care systems should consider addressing social needs and community resources as a path to improving health outcomes."

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate oral health knowledge for stroke care and the clinical practices performed for oral hygiene care in Malaysia. BACKGROUND: Oral hygiene care following stroke is important as the mouth can act as a reservoir for opportunistic infections that can lead to aspirational pneumonia. DESIGN: A national cross-sectional survey was conducted in Malaysia among public hospitals where specialist stroke rehabilitation care is provided. METHODS: All (16) hospitals were invited to participate, and site visits were conducted. A standardised questionnaire was employed to determine nurses' oral health knowledge for stroke care and existing clinical practices for oral hygiene care. Variations in oral health knowledge and clinical practices for oral hygiene care were examined. RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed by 806 nurses across 13 hospitals. Oral health knowledge scores varied among the nurses; their mean score was 3.7 (SD 1.1) out of a possible 5.0. Approximately two-thirds (63.6%, n = 513) reported that some form of ""mouth cleaning"" was performed for stroke patients routinely. However, only a third (38.3%, n = 309) reported to perform or assist with the clinical practice of oral hygiene care daily. Their oral health knowledge of stroke care was associated with clinical practices for oral hygiene care (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical practice of providing oral hygiene care is less than ideal, and there are deficiencies in oral health knowledge for stroke care. Oral health knowledge was associated with clinical practice of providing oral hygiene care. This has implications for training and integrating oral hygiene care within stroke rehabilitation."

BACKGROUND: Several occupations and occupational exposures have been investigated for associations with Parkinson's disease. Common findings are increased risk associated with pesticide exposure and no association between Parkinson's disease and welding. METHODS: We explored the association between a broad range of possible occupational risk factors and Parkinson's disease as well as Parkinson's disease plus other forms of Parkinsonism (referred to as Parkinsonian disorders), using prospectively collected data in the population-based Swedish Twin Registry. A cohort of 14,169 Swedish men was followed for up to 43 years. We identified 234 Parkinsonian disorder cases including 204 Parkinson's disease cases with complete data. We assessed exposure to 14 chemical and biological compounds through a job exposure matrix. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for age, smoking, and education were used to estimate the relative risk of disease associated with exposure. RESULTS: Exposure to inorganic dust was associated with increased risk of Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonian disorders, HR 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.4) and 1.5 (1.0-2.2) respectively. There was no association between Parkinson's disease or Parkinsonian disorders and occupational exposure to pesticides, welding smoke, metal dust, wood dust, animal handling, stone and concrete dust, chrome and nickel dust, quartz dust, organic dust, oil, asbestos, organic solvents and irritating gas.

There was no association between Parkinson's disease or Parkinsonian disorders and occupational exposure to pesticides, welding smoke, metal dust, wood dust, animal handling, stone and concrete dust, chrome and nickel dust, quartz dust, organic dust, oil, asbestos, organic solvents and irritating gas. CONCLUSIONS: Inorganic dust should be explored further as a potential risk factor for Parkinson's disease.

BACKGROUND: Several occupations and occupational exposures have been investigated for associations with Parkinson's disease. Common findings are increased risk associated with pesticide exposure and no association between Parkinson's disease and welding. METHODS: We explored the association between a broad range of possible occupational risk factors and Parkinson's disease as well as Parkinson's disease plus other forms of Parkinsonism (referred to as Parkinsonian disorders), using prospectively collected data in the population-based Swedish Twin Registry. A cohort of 14,169 Swedish men was followed for up to 43 years. We identified 234 Parkinsonian disorder cases including 204 Parkinson's disease cases with complete data. We assessed exposure to 14 chemical and biological compounds through a job exposure matrix.

There was no association between Parkinson's disease or Parkinsonian disorders and occupational exposure to pesticides, welding smoke, metal dust, wood dust, animal handling, stone and concrete dust, chrome and nickel dust, quartz dust, organic dust, oil, asbestos, organic solvents and irritating gas. CONCLUSIONS: Inorganic dust should be explored further as a potential risk factor for Parkinson's disease. Occupational exposure to pesticides and twelve other compounds explored in this study may not be associated with risk of Parkinson's disease in Swedish men."

BACKGROUND: Several occupations and occupational exposures have been investigated for associations with Parkinson's disease. Common findings are increased risk associated with pesticide exposure and no association between Parkinson's disease and welding. METHODS: We explored the association between a broad range of possible occupational risk factors and Parkinson's disease as well as Parkinson's disease plus other forms of Parkinsonism (referred to as Parkinsonian disorders), using prospectively collected data in the population-based Swedish Twin Registry. A cohort of 14,169 Swedish men was followed for up to 43 years. We identified 234 Parkinsonian disorder cases including 204 Parkinson's disease cases with complete data. We assessed exposure to 14 chemical and biological compounds through a job exposure matrix.

The relationships of different histologic types of cutaneous malignant melanoma to occupational and recreational sunlight exposure, habits of clothing, sunburn histories, and use of sunscreening agents were examined in a case-control study of 507 patients and 507 matched controls in Western Australia. Variations in relationships according to the primary site of melanoma were also examined. An increased incidence rate of superficial spreading melanoma was associated with low total outdoor exposure in early adulthood and frequent participation in boating and fishing. Superficial spreading melanoma of the trunk was also related to frequency of sunbathing at ages 15-24 years and of exposure of the trunk while working outdoors. In women the rate ratio for all types of melanoma occurring on the trunk was estimated at 13.0 (95% confidence interval, 2.0-83.9) in those who wore a bikini or bathed nude at ages 15-24 years compared with those wearing a conservative one-piece bathing suit. There was little evidence that sunbathing or wearing a bikini within 10 years of case diagnosis were risk factors for melanoma of the trunk. After control of confounding due to constitutional factors, only Hutchinson's melanotic freckle melanoma showed a relationship to severe sunburn. For nodular melanoma, sunburn appeared to be protective. Although many of the results supported the hypothesis that melanomas other than the Hutchinson's melanotic freckle type are related to occasional bursts of recreational sun exposure during a susceptible period in early adult life, little support for the hypothesis was obtained when recreational sun exposure was expressed as a proportion of total outdoor exposure, which had been considered a priori to be an index of intermittent sunlight exposure."

The relationships of different histologic types of cutaneous malignant melanoma to occupational and recreational sunlight exposure, habits of clothing, sunburn histories, and use of sunscreening agents were examined in a case-control study of 507 patients and 507 matched controls in Western Australia. Variations in relationships according to the primary site of melanoma were also examined. An increased incidence rate of superficial spreading melanoma was associated with low total outdoor exposure in early adulthood and frequent participation in boating and fishing. Superficial spreading melanoma of the trunk was also related to frequency of sunbathing at ages 15-24 years and of exposure of the trunk while working outdoors. In women the rate ratio for all types of melanoma occurring on the trunk was estimated at 13.0 (95% confidence interval, 2.0-83.9) in those who wore a bikini or bathed nude at ages 15-24 years compared with those wearing a conservative one-piece bathing suit.

OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a heritable condition with well-established risk-reducing behaviours. Studies have shown that beliefs about the causes of obesity are associated with diet and exercise behaviour. Identifying mechanisms linking causal beliefs and behaviours is important for obesity prevention and control. DESIGN: Cross-sectional multi-level regression analyses of self-efficacy for weight control as a possible mediator of obesity attributions (diet, physical activity, genetic) and preventive behaviours in 487 non-Hispanic White women from South King County, Washington. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported daily fruit and vegetable intake and weekly leisure-time physical activity. RESULTS: Diet causal beliefs were positively associated with fruit and vegetable intake, with self-efficacy for weight control partially accounting for this association. Self-efficacy for weight control also indirectly linked physical activity attributions and physical activity behaviour. Relationships between genetic causal beliefs, self-efficacy for weight control, and obesity-related behaviours differed by obesity status. Self-efficacy for weight control contributed to negative associations between genetic causal attributions and obesity-related behaviours in non-obese, but not obese, women. CONCLUSION: Self-efficacy is an important construct to include in studies of genetic causal beliefs and behavioural self-regulation. Theoretical and longitudinal work is needed to clarify the causal nature of these relationships and other mediating and moderating factors."

DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. INTERVENTION: Elders having at least five teeth with exposed roots, no serious medical problems and basic self-care ability (including oral hygiene practices) were randomly allocated into one of four prevention groups. Individualised oral hygiene instruction was provided to each participant, focusing on effective brushing with a manual toothbrush, and use of fluoride toothpaste was recommended. Before applications of the study agents, a piece of gauze was used to clean and dry the teeth. Then water (placebo control), chlorhexidine varnish (Cervitec, Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan, Liechtenstein), sodium fluoride varnish (Duraphat, Pharbil Waltrop GmbH, Waltrop, Germany) or SDF solution (Saforide, Toyo Seiyaku Kasei Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was applied onto the exposed root surfaces of participants in the respective groups by means of a disposable microbrush. The participants were instructed not to eat for half an hour after treatment. Applications of water or SDF solution were repeated every 12 months, and applications of chlorhexidine varnish or sodium fluoride varnish were repeated every three months. OUTCOME MEASURES: Root Caries Index (RCI) was calculated as follows: (no. of root caries lesions/no. of teeth with gingival recession/person) x 100. Treatment effects were also measured by prevented fraction (PF), relative risk and the number (of elders) needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one elder from developing root caries. RESULTS: Two thirds (203/306) of the included elders were followed for three years. Significantly lower relative risks for developing new root caries were found in the elders in the chlorhexidine, sodium fluoride and SDF groups compared with the control (OHI only) group. The mean numbers of new root caries surfaces in the four groups were 2.5, 1.1, 0.9 and 0.7 respectively (ANOVA, p < 0.001). The prevented fraction and numbers needed to treat are shown in Table 1. CONCLUSIONS: Applications of SDF solution, sodium fluoride varnish and chlorhexidine varnish are more effective in preventing new root caries than OHI alone. The results of this study provide support for the clinical and community use of the three test materials, in addition to improvement in oral hygiene, to prevent the development of root caries in institutionalised elders."

Then water (placebo control), chlorhexidine varnish (Cervitec, Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan, Liechtenstein), sodium fluoride varnish (Duraphat, Pharbil Waltrop GmbH, Waltrop, Germany) or SDF solution (Saforide, Toyo Seiyaku Kasei Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was applied onto the exposed root surfaces of participants in the respective groups by means of a disposable microbrush. The participants were instructed not to eat for half an hour after treatment. Applications of water or SDF solution were repeated every 12 months, and applications of chlorhexidine varnish or sodium fluoride varnish were repeated every three months. OUTCOME MEASURES: Root Caries Index (RCI) was calculated as follows: (no. of root caries lesions/no. of teeth with gingival recession/person) x 100. Treatment effects were also measured by prevented fraction (PF), relative risk and the number (of elders) needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one elder from developing root caries. RESULTS: Two thirds (203/306) of the included elders were followed for three years. Significantly lower relative risks for developing new root caries were found in the elders in the chlorhexidine, sodium fluoride and SDF groups compared with the control (OHI only) group. The mean numbers of new root caries surfaces in the four groups were 2.5, 1.1, 0.9 and 0.7 respectively (ANOVA, p < 0.001). The prevented fraction and numbers needed to treat are shown in Table 1. CONCLUSIONS: Applications of SDF solution, sodium fluoride varnish and chlorhexidine varnish are more effective in preventing new root caries than OHI alone. The results of this study provide support for the clinical and community use of the three test materials, in addition to improvement in oral hygiene, to prevent the development of root caries in institutionalised elders."

Genetic factors are unlikely to explain these rapid increases. Among the potential environmental factors, exposure to ambient air pollution has been intensely debated. Besides passive smoking, which has convincingly been shown to increase the risk for asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness among exposed children, the evidence to suggest that outdoor pollution to sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, diesel exhaust, and ozone is causally related with the inception of allergic diseases is poor. Rather, factors associated with the lifestyle of populations or families, such as socioeconomic status, allergen exposure, sibship size, early childhood infections, dietary habits, and growing up in anthroposophic families or a farming environment, may prove to be of greater relevance.

OBJECTIVES: The aims were to investigate whether occupational noise increased the risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke and to elucidate interactions with stressful working conditions in a cohort of Swedish men. DESIGN: This is a prospective cohort study on CHD and stroke in Swedish men followed until death, hospital discharge or until 75 years of age, using Swedish national registers on cause of death and hospital discharges. Baseline data on occupation from 1974 to 1977 were used for classification of levels of occupational noise and job demand-control. Cox regression was used to analyse HRs for CHD and stroke. SETTING: Swedish men born in 1915-1925. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: CHD and stroke. PARTICIPANTS: The participants of the study were men from the Primary Prevention Study, a random sample of 10 000 men born in 1915-1925 in Gothenburg. Subjects with CHD or stroke at baseline or were not employed were excluded. The remaining subjects with complete baseline data on occupation, weight, height, hypertension, diabetes, serum cholesterol and smoking constituted the study sample (5753 men). RESULTS: There was an increased risk for CHD in relation to noise levels 75-85 dB(A) and >85 dB(A) compared with <75 dB(A) (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.31, and HR 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.63, respectively). Exposure to noise peaks also increased the risk for CHD (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.38). Among those with high strain (high demands and low control) combined with noise >75 dB(A), the risk for CHD further increased (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.73). There was no significantly increased risk for stroke in any noise category. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to occupational noise was associated with an increased risk for CHD and the risk further increased among those with concomitant exposure to high strain. None of the analysed variables were related to increased risk for stroke."

BACKGROUND: Although there is preliminary evidence that alexithymia may influence the course of coronary heart disease (CHD), there are no studies exploring attempts to modify alexithymic characteristics in cardiac patients. METHOD: Twenty post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients (19 men and 1 woman) were placed in a treatment group, which received weekly group psychotherapy for 4 months. Seventeen post-MI patients (16 men and 1 woman) were placed in a comparison group which received two educational sessions over a period of 1 month. All subjects completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS) before the start of group therapy, at the end of the 4-month period, and in follow-up assessment after 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year intervals. RESULTS: In the psychotherapy treatment group, there was a significant reduction in the mean TAS score following group therapy, which was maintained over the 2-year follow-up period. In the educational group, there were no significant changes in mean TAS scores between the initial testing and any of the follow-up intervals. On an individual basis, a decrease to a lower level of TAS scores occurred in a higher percentage of patients in the treatment group than in the educational group. Over the 2-year follow-up period, patients with decreased alexithymia following group therapy experienced fewer cardiac events (reinfarction, sudden cardiac death, or rehospitalization for rhythm disorder or severe angina) than patients whose alexithymia remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that group psychotherapy is able to decrease alexithymia and that for many patients this change can be maintained for at least 2 years. A reduction in the degree of alexithymia seems to influence favorably the clinical course of CHD."

BACKGROUND: Obesity has become an epidemic in many countries and is supporting a billion dollar industry involved in promoting weight loss through diet, exercise and surgical procedures. Because of difficulties in maintaining body weight reduction, a pattern of weight cycling often occurs (so called 'yo-yo' dieting) that may result in deleterious outcomes to health. There is controversy about cardiovascular benefits of yo-yo dieting, and an animal model is needed to better understand the contributions of major diet and body weight changes on heart and vascular functions. Our purpose is to determine the effects of weight cycling on cardiac function and atherosclerosis development in a mouse model. METHODS: We used low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice due to their sensitivity to metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases when fed high-fat diets. Alternating ad libitum feeding of high-fat and low-fat (rodent chow) diets was used to instigate weight cycling during a 29-week period. Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity tests were done at 22 and 24 weeks, echocardiograms at 25 weeks and atherosclerosis and plasma lipoproteins assessed at 29 weeks. RESULTS: Mice subjected to weight cycling showed improvements in glucose homeostasis during the weight loss cycle. Weight-cycled mice showed a reduction in the severity of atherosclerosis as compared with high-fat diet-fed mice. However, atherosclerosis still persisted in weight-cycled mice as compared with mice fed rodent chow. Cardiac function was impaired in weight-cycled mice and matched with that of mice fed only the high-fat diet. CONCLUSION: This model provides an initial structure in which to begin detailed studies of diet, calorie restriction and surgical modifications on energy balance and metabolic diseases. This model also shows differential effects of yo-yo dieting on metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases."

BACKGROUND: Obesity has become an epidemic in many countries and is supporting a billion dollar industry involved in promoting weight loss through diet, exercise and surgical procedures. Because of difficulties in maintaining body weight reduction, a pattern of weight cycling often occurs (so called 'yo-yo' dieting) that may result in deleterious outcomes to health. There is controversy about cardiovascular benefits of yo-yo dieting, and an animal model is needed to better understand the contributions of major diet and body weight changes on heart and vascular functions. Our purpose is to determine the effects of weight cycling on cardiac function and atherosclerosis development in a mouse model. METHODS: We used low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice due to their sensitivity to metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases when fed high-fat diets. Alternating ad libitum feeding of high-fat and low-fat (rodent chow) diets was used to instigate weight cycling during a 29-week period. Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity tests were done at 22 and 24 weeks, echocardiograms at 25 weeks and atherosclerosis and plasma lipoproteins assessed at 29 weeks. RESULTS: Mice subjected to weight cycling showed improvements in glucose homeostasis during the weight loss cycle. Weight-cycled mice showed a reduction in the severity of atherosclerosis as compared with high-fat diet-fed mice.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of single and combination treatment modalities among US children aged 5-18 years who were diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Treatments included: (i) stimulant pharmacotherapy alone; (ii) psychotherapy and/or mental health counselling alone; (ii) a combination; or (iv) no treatment. Data from the US National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) for the years 1995-99, were used for this analysis. Office-based physician-patient visits documenting a recorded diagnosis of ADHD (ICD-9-CM codes 314.00 or 314.01) were extracted from the NAMCS. Findings are presented for children diagnosed with ADHD with or without comorbid mental illness, for children diagnosed with ADHD without comorbid mental illness, by gender, and by age groups. Over the timeframe 1995-99, an estimated 14 402 090 office-based visits documented a diagnosis of ADHD, with (24%) or without (76%) comorbid mental illness, among children aged 5-18 years. Overall, the most frequent treatment was stimulant medication alone (42.0%). This was followed by the combination treatment of stimulant medication plus psychotherapy and/or mental health counselling (32.1%). Only 10.8% of the children received psychotherapy and/or mental health counselling alone; 15.1% received no treatment beyond the office-based visit. This pattern was consistent for boys and girls; however, a larger proportion of boys (11.7%) were receiving psychotherapy and/or mental health counselling alone than girls (8.2%). More girls (18.7%) were receiving no treatment option compared to boys (13.9%). The percentage of children receiving psychotherapy and/or mental health counselling alone increased with each age group (6.7%, 5-8 years; 11.3%, 9-12 years; 13.6%, 13-18 years), as did the combination treatment of stimulant medication plus psychotherapy and/or mental health counselling (28.2%, 31%, 37.3%, respectively). Only 8.2% of children age 13-18 years were receiving no treatment option compared to 16.9% of children age 9-12 years, and 19.5% of those aged 5-8 years.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe obesity-risk behaviours (diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviour) and examine the relationships of the obesity-risk behaviours with body mass index (BMI) in school-aged Korean American children. BACKGROUND: Korean American children have a risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing obesity-related complications; however, there is limited research about obesity-risk behaviours in Korean American children. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: Obesity-risk behaviours of children were assessed with well-validated self-report questionnaires (i.e., Elementary-level School-based Nutrition Monitoring Questionnaire) from children and their mothers. Height and weight of children were measured. Data were analysed with bivariate and multivariate analyses using mixed effects models to incorporate the correlation within siblings. RESULTS: A total of 170 Korean American children (mean age 10.9 [2.0] years; 52.4% girls; mean BMI 19.3 [3.2]; 28.7% >=85 percentiles) participated in the study. Only 38.3% of Korean American children met established recommendations of five fruits/vegetables per day; 56.5% met recommendations for more than 3 days per week of vigorous physical activity; and 40.8% met recommendations for <2 hr of recreational screen time per day. Sixty per cent and 88.8% of children met the recommendation of sleep on a weekday and weekend, respectively. Only screen time was positively associated with child BMI z-score (beta = 0.08; p < .03). CONCLUSION: Healthcare providers need to be aware of the increased rate of overweight and obesity in Korean American children and initiate clinical interventions to improve obesity-risk behaviours, especially sedentary behaviour, in Korean American children.

We examined hair product use (hair dyes, chemical relaxers and cholesterol or placenta-containing conditioners) among African American (AA) and White women, and explored associations with breast cancer. Multivariable-adjusted models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to describe the associations of interest among 2280 cases (1508 AA and 772 White) and 2005 controls (1290 AA and 715 White). Among controls, hair dye use was more common among Whites than AAs (58 versus 30%), while relaxer (88 versus 5%) and deep conditioner use (59 versus 6%) was more common among AAs. Among AAs, use of dark hair dye shades was associated with increased breast cancer risk (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.20-1.90) and use of dark shades (OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.30-2.26) and higher frequency of use (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.01-1.84) were associated with ER+ disease. Among Whites, relaxer use (OR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.11-2.74) and dual use of relaxers and hair dyes (OR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.35-4.27) was associated with breast cancer; use of dark hair dyes was associated with increased ER+ disease (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.01-2.33), and relaxer use was associated with increased ER- disease (OR = 2.56, 95% CI: 1.06-6.16). These novel findings provide support a relationship between the use of some hair products and breast cancer. Further examinations of hair products as important exposures contributing to breast cancer carcinogenesis are necessary."

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain and rheumatic diseases in subjects over 18 years of age from the canton of Cuenca, Ecuador. Cross-sectional analytical community-based study was conducted in subjects over 18 years of age using the validated Community-Oriented Program for the Control of Rheumatic Diseases (COPCORD) questionnaire. Random sampling was used. The questionnaire was administered by standardized health workers. Subjects were visited house by house. Subjects positive for musculoskeletal (MSK) pain in the last 7 days and at some point in life were assessed by rheumatologists to confirm the diagnosis. A total of 4877 subjects participated, with an average age of 42.8 (SD 18.8) years of age; 59.7 % were women; 69.7 % lived in urban areas. 32.5 % reported MSK pain in the last 7 days and 45.7 % at some point in life. The prevalence of knee osteoarthritis was 7.4 %, hand osteoarthritis 5.3 %, low back pain 9.3 %, rheumatoid arthritis 0.8 %, fibromyalgia 2 %, gout 0.4 %, and lupus 0.06 %. Subjects from rural areas reported experiencing more MSK pain in the last 7 days and at some point in life, lower income, poorer health-care coverage, and increased physical activity involving repetitive tasks such as lifting weights or cooking with firewood. MSK pain prevalence was high. Osteoarthritis and low back pain were the most common diseases. Age, sex, physical activity, repetitive tasks, living in a rural area, and lack of health-care coverage were found to be associated with MSK pain."

OBJECTIVE: We documented previously that if study quality is accounted for, evidence from occupational cohort studies on benzene supports a possible association with some lymphoma subtypes, in particular multiple myeloma, and acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Here, we extend these analyses to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). METHODS: Three strategies to assess study quality (stratification by the year-of-start of follow-up, stratification by the strength of the reported acute myeloid leukemia (AML) association, and stratification by the quality of benzene exposure assessment) were employed in a meta-analysis of occupational benzene exposure and CML. We hypothesized that stratification by these study quality dimensions would identify a subgroup of occupational cohort studies that is most informative for the evaluation of the possible association between benzene and CML. RESULTS: The overall meta-relative risk (mRR) was non-significantly elevated (1.23; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-1.63). The mRRs increased with increasing study quality for all dimensions with a significant elevation for studies with start of follow-up after 1970 (1.67; 95% CI: 1.02-2.74). The highest study quality stratum for AML significance and exposure quality showed an elevated but non-significant increased mRR (1.40; 95% CI: 0.86-2.27, and 1.68; 95% CI: 0.74-3.84, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by low statistical power, the current meta-analysis provides support for a possible association of occupational exposure to benzene and the risk of CML."

BACKGROUND: The chronic kidney disease, blood hypertension and diabetes are recognized as civilization diseases that affect more and more people. The probability of encountering a patient suffering from these diseases is increasing. As such, it appears crucial to better understand the specific dental needs of such groups of patients. The aim of the work was to assess the oral hygiene status and the needs of patients suffering from the end-stage chronic kidney disease, arterial hypertension or/and diabetes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two hundred and twenty eight patients were included in the research. One hundred and eighty patients were hemodialized in Diaverum dialysis stations and 48 patients were from the Conservative Dentistry with Endodontics Clinic of the Academic Centre of Dentistry in Bytom, Silesian Medical University in Katowice, and from the Dentistry Division of the Arnika Clinic in Zabrze, and were not not diagnosed with any of the diseases mentioned. The research scheme was divided into 3 parts, consisting of an analysis of the general health socio-economic status, a survey and an assessment of oral health. RESULTS: The patients who were not suffering from any of the discussed diseases were more aware of how to properly perform hygienic procedures. Most of the patients from both the control and examined groups were not using any rinsing solutions. A higher percentage of patients in the control group was using dental floss, changing their toothbrush every 3 months and brushing their teeth for >=2 min. The Aproximal Plaque Index and the Oral Hygiene Index-Simplified values in the control group were significantly lower in comparison to the examined group.

BACKGROUND: The chronic kidney disease, blood hypertension and diabetes are recognized as civilization diseases that affect more and more people. The probability of encountering a patient suffering from these diseases is increasing. As such, it appears crucial to better understand the specific dental needs of such groups of patients. The aim of the work was to assess the oral hygiene status and the needs of patients suffering from the end-stage chronic kidney disease, arterial hypertension or/and diabetes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two hundred and twenty eight patients were included in the research. One hundred and eighty patients were hemodialized in Diaverum dialysis stations and 48 patients were from the Conservative Dentistry with Endodontics Clinic of the Academic Centre of Dentistry in Bytom, Silesian Medical University in Katowice, and from the Dentistry Division of the Arnika Clinic in Zabrze, and were not not diagnosed with any of the diseases mentioned. The research scheme was divided into 3 parts, consisting of an analysis of the general health socio-economic status, a survey and an assessment of oral health. RESULTS: The patients who were not suffering from any of the discussed diseases were more aware of how to properly perform hygienic procedures. Most of the patients from both the control and examined groups were not using any rinsing solutions. A higher percentage of patients in the control group was using dental floss, changing their toothbrush every 3 months and brushing their teeth for >=2 min. The Aproximal Plaque Index and the Oral Hygiene Index-Simplified values in the control group were significantly lower in comparison to the examined group. CONCLUSIONS: The socio-economic status of hemodialized patients was low, which in most cases was a result of the difficulties in starting a job.

To summarize earlier findings on the association of dietary intake and serum levels of trans fatty acids with risk of breast cancer through a dose-response meta-analysis. METHODS: The online databases of PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, Science Direct and Embase were searched for relevant publications up to June 2018, using MeSH and non-MeSH keywords. In total, 7 prospective studies [6 cohort studies and one nested case-control study] were included on total dietary trans fat intake, and five studies [1 cohort study and 4 nested case-control studies] were included about serum trans fatty acids. Assessment of study quality was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Study-specific RRs were combined via fixed-effects model to compute overall RRs. RESULTS: Participants were apparently healthy aged 26 years or older. We observed no significant relationship between dietary intake of total trans fatty acids and risk of breast cancer (pooled effect size: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.95-1.10, P = 0.403). Combining 3 effect sizes from 2 prospective and one nested case-control study, no significant relation was seen between dietary intake of CLA and risk of breast cancer (pooled effect size: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.95-1.17, P = 0.513). Based on 5 effect sizes, each additional 1 g/day dietary intake of total trans fats was not significantly associated with risk of breast cancer (RR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.99-1.01). In addition, it seems that serum levels of trans fats might be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer only among postmenopausal women (Pooled effect size: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.04-1.81, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, dietary intake of trans fatty acids was not associated with risk of breast cancer; however, a significant positive association was seen between serum trans fats and risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women."

BACKGROUND: Less favored social classes usually have more unhealthy life-styles and a more difficult access to Health Resources. AIM: To study the possible association between poverty and some common diseases, in a population of postmenopausal women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four hundred and forty nine poor women aged 56 +/- 12 years and 776 consecutive women aged 53 +/- 12 years, answered a personal interview about their lifestyles and medications used. Their medical records were reviewed and they were subjected to a complete physical examination, including weight and height measurement. A fasting blood sample was also obtained. Poverty was defined according to criteria of the Spanish National Institute of Statistics that is based on the income in Euros and the number of family members that share such income. RESULTS: A higher proportion of poor women live in rural areas. They were shorter, had a higher weight and thus a higher body mass index, smoked less and drank less alcohol than their non-poor counterparts drink. The consumption of caffeine, the actual calcium intake and the physical activity during leisure time was similar in both groups. Compared with their counterparts, poor women had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (15.9 and 10.1% respectively, p = < 0.01), obesity (44.2 and 24.3% respectively, p < 0.01) hypertension (24.3 and 16.4%o respectively, p<0.01) and autoimmune rheumatic diseases (7.8 and 4.8% > respectively, p = 0.03). A multiple logistic regression model showed that obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcohol consumption and living in rural areas, were independently associated to poverty. CONCLUSIONS: Poor postmenopausal women have a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, obesity, autoimmune rheumatic diseases and hypertension and lower frequency of smoking and alcohol consumption than their affluent counterparts do."

FINDINGS: A total of 47 studies with 98 911 patients were included. The pooled mean sleep duration was 7.15 hours/day in patients with diabetes and 7.49 hours/day in healthy controls. The estimated percentage of short sleep duration of less than 6 hours/day was 23.0% in patients with diabetes and 12.3% in healthy controls, while the proportion of short sleep duration of less than 7 hours/day was 38.0% in patients with diabetes and 14.1% in healthy controls. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Short sleep duration was common in Chinese patients with diabetes."

BACKGROUND: Adequate sleep and physical activity have been linked to the overall well-being of both medical and psychiatric patients. Patients with schizophrenia have shown abnormal sleep patterns and decreased physical activity that were linked to their psychopathology and physical health. These phenomena are not studied yet in Arab patients with schizophrenia. The purpose of this study is to study the sleep and exercise patterns in Arab patients with schizophrenia compared with those of healthy controls. METHOD: A total of 99 patients with schizophrenia and 101 controls were recruited. Arabic versions of sleep, exercise, socio-demographic, and clinical questionnaires were administered as well as the validated scales to measure psychopathology, depression, and suicidality in these participants. RESULTS: The majority of patients with schizophrenia slept more than 8 h per day and exercised less when compared with controls. Sleep quality was worse in those with higher depression score and higher suicidality scores were seen in patients with lower sleep duration. Multinomial regression showed that patients with schizophrenia have higher odds of sleeping more than 8 h even after controlling for the intake of antipsychotics, age, gender, smoking status, and other confounding factors. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that Arab patients with schizophrenia are at increased risk of having longer sleep duration with inadequate physical activity, which are correlating with worsening of depressive symptoms and suicidality. Thus, more attention should be paid to the changes in sleep patterns and level of exercise when treating Arab patients with schizophrenia."

BACKGROUND: Obesity in children is increasing worldwide. Malnutrition has become a double burden challenge of public health concern in developing countries. Childhood obesity increases the risk of chronic disease in childhood as well as adulthood. However, information is very scarce about childhood obesity in developing countries specifically in Ethiopia. Therefore, we aimed to assess childhood overweight, obesity and associated factors among primary school children at Dire Dawa, Eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: A school based cross-sectional study was conducted in Dire Dawa from 1(st) to 30(th) March, 2016. Study participants were selected using multistage sampling method. Pre-tested self-administered questionnaire, face to face interview technique and anthropometric measurements were used to collect data by eight well trained data collectors. Data were coded, cleaned and entered into EpiData software version 3.5.1, and exported into SPSS (version 21.0) statistical software, for data analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were carried out to identify associated factors with childhood overweight and obesity. Statistical significance was declared using Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) at 95% CI and p-value less than 0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence of overweight and obesity were 14.7% (95% CI: 11.7, 18.0) and 5.8% (95% CI: 3.6, 8.0), respectively. Children who were from private school (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.4, 8.5), from families belonged to high socioeconomic class (AOR = 16.9, 95% CI: 6.5, 23.9), preferred sweetened foods (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.1), had not engaged in regular physical exercise (AOR = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.5, 9.8), had experienced sedentary life style like spent their free time watching TV (AOR = 3.6, 95% CI: 1.6, 7.9), play computer game (AOR = 4.6, 95% CI:1.4,15.4), and were not having close friends (AOR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.4, 6.2) were significantly associated with overweight/obesity risk.

METHODS: A one-day cross-sectional survey was used in selected wards (Pediatrics, Surgery, Intensive Care Unit, Renal Diseases, Gastroenterology Diseases, Respiratory Diseases, and Endocrinology). Unavailable patients and those discharged within 24 hours were excluded. Anthropometric data included body weight, height (or length), and mid-upper arm circumference. The type, severity, and prevalence rate of malnutrition were defined based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. RESULTS: The sample was hospitalized children and adults: 108 and 571 were children aged 6 months to 18.9 years old and adult patients, respectively. The overall rate of pediatric wasting (weight-for-height <= -2 SD or BMI <= -2 SD, kg/m(2)) was 19.0% (n= 19/100) and that of stunting (height-for-age <= -2 SD) was 13.9% (n=14/101). Using either the mid-upper arm circumference <11.5 cm or the weight-for-height and weight-for-length <= -3 SD, the rate of severe wasting among children aged 6-59 months old was 7.0% (n=3/43). None of the children were obese based on weight-for-length, weight-for-height, or BMI. In adults, the prevalence of under-nutrition (BMI<18.5 kg/m(2)) was 33.3% (n=141/423) while that of obesity (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2)) was 0.9% (n=4/423). Adults admitted to the Respiratory Diseases ward had the highest prevalence of under-nutrition, 40.9% (n=38/93). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of malnutrition was high in this cohort of hospitalized patients, particularly in adults, but comparable to other published reports. Obesity was nearly nonexistent in both children and adults."

OBJECTIVECentral nervous system (CNS) infections cause significant morbidity and mortality and often require neurosurgical intervention for proper diagnosis and treatment. However, neither the international burden of CNS infection, nor the current capacity of the neurosurgical workforce to treat these diseases is well characterized. The objective of this study was to elucidate the global incidence of surgically relevant CNS infection, highlighting geographic areas for targeted improvement in neurosurgical capacity.METHODSA systematic literature review and meta-analysis were performed to capture studies published between 1990 and 2016. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched using variations of terms relating to CNS infection and epidemiology (incidence, prevalence, burden, case fatality, etc.). To deliver a geographic breakdown of disease, results were pooled using the random-effects model and stratified by WHO region and national income status for the different CNS infection types.RESULTSThe search yielded 10,906 studies, 154 of which were used in the final qualitative analysis. A meta-analysis was performed to compute disease incidence by using data extracted from 71 of the 154 studies. The remaining 83 studies were excluded from the quantitative analysis because they did not report incidence. A total of 508,078 cases of CNS infections across all studies were included, with a total sample size of 130,681,681 individuals. Mean patient age was 35.8 years (range: newborn to 95 years), and the male/female ratio was 1:1.74. Among the 71 studies with incidence data, 39 were based in high-income countries, 25 in middle-income countries, and 7 in low-income countries. The pooled incidence of studied CNS infections was consistently highest in low-income countries, followed by middle- and then high-income countries. Regarding WHO regions, Africa had the highest pooled incidence of bacterial meningitis (65 cases/100,000 people), neurocysticercosis (650/100,000), and tuberculous spondylodiscitis (55/100,000), whereas Southeast Asia had the highest pooled incidence of intracranial abscess (49/100,000), and Europe had the highest pooled incidence of nontuberculous vertebral spondylodiscitis (5/100,000). Overall, few articles reported data on deaths associated with infection. The limited case fatality data revealed the highest case fatality for tuberculous meningitis/spondylodiscitis (21.1%) and the lowest for neurocysticercosis (5.5%). In all five disease categories, funnel plots assessing for publication bias were asymmetrical and suggested that the results may underestimate the incidence of disease.CONCLUSIONSThis systematic review and meta-analysis approximates the global incidence of neurosurgically relevant infectious diseases. These results underscore the disproportionate burden of CNS infections in the developing world, where there is a tremendous demand to provide training and resources for high-quality neurosurgical care."

Data were extracted using a standardized form that recorded study design, study population, type of cases, comparison group, sources of data on personal exposure to hair dyes, method of data collection, type of exposure data collected, covariates, and results. This review identified 10 epidemiologic studies published in the English literature that examined personal use of hair dyes and lymphomas or MM. These studies include three evaluations of Hodgkin's disease, five of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), two of lymphomas with type not specified, and six of MM. For Hodgkin's disease, one case-control study reported some positive associations with use of permanent hair dyes, whereas two cohort studies found no associations with ever use of hair dyes. For NHL and MM, several evaluations suggest associations with use of permanent dyes, particularly with duration, frequency, age at first use, and dark colors. However, these associations are not consistent within and between studies. For lymphomas with type not specified, one study was superseded by a more recent report with NHL specific data and a second study was limited by small numbers of exposed subjects. At this time, it is not possible to determine if the inconsistent associations between permanent hair dyes and NHL and MM reflect sampling variability or differences in methods between studies. Because an appreciable fraction of the population has potential exposure to permanent hair dyes, elucidation of such issues may be warranted with studies that include adequate numbers of exposed subjects and that elicit information on personal use of hair dyes over time."

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to investigate whether air pollution from traffic at a residence is associated with mortality related to type 1 or type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We followed up 52,061 participants in the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort for diabetes-related mortality in the nationwide Register of Causes of Death, from baseline in 1993-1997 up to the end of 2009, and traced their residential addresses since 1971 in the Central Population Registry. We used dispersion-modelled concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) since 1971 and amount of traffic at the baseline residence as indicators of traffic-related air pollution and used Cox regression models to estimate mortality-rate ratios (MRRs) with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: Mean levels of NO2 at the residence since 1971 were significantly associated with mortality from diabetes. Exposure above 19.4 mug/m(3) (upper quartile) was associated with a MRR of 2.15 (95% CI 1.21, 3.83) when compared with below 13.6 mug/m(3) (lower quartile), corresponding to an MRR of 1.31 (95% CI 0.98, 1.76) per 10 mug/m(3) NO2 after adjustment for potential confounders.

BACKGROUND: Worldwide, female sex workers (FSW) represent a vulnerable population for oral diseases due to many risk factors including HIV infection and drug abuse. In sub-Saharan Africa, little is known about the burden of oral diseases and their determinants in vulnerable populations. The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence and associated factors of oral diseases among FSW. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted among FSW who attended a dedicated non-profit clinic in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire from June to August 2013. Data about the presence of dental caries, periodontitis and oral-mucosal lesions were collected by a dentist during an oral examination. Behavioural information related to oral hygiene habits as well as tobacco and alcohol consumption were collected through a standardized questionnaire. Information related to HIV infection including HIV diagnosis, last known CD4 count and antiretroviral therapy were documented through a medical chart review. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with oral diseases. RESULTS: A total of 249 FSW with a median age of 29 years, [Inter Quartile Range (IQR) = 23-36] and a median duration of sex work of 24 months [IQR 9-60]) were included. Current tobacco use and hazardous alcohol use were reported in 21.7 % and 19.7 % of FSW, respectively. The estimated prevalence of HIV infection was 33.7 % [95 % confidence interval (CI); 27.8 - 39.6]) and 82.1 % of HIV-infected FSW were on antiretroviral therapy . The prevalence of dental caries, periodontitis and oral-mucosal lesions were 62.3 % [95 % CI 55.5 - 67.5], 14.5 % [95 % CI 10.2 - 18.9] and 8.2 % [95 % CI 4.8 - 11.5], respectively. In multivariate analysis, periodontitis, oral-mucosal lesions and HIV infection were associated with odds ratio of 2.6 [95 % CI, 1.2-5.8]) and 50.0 [95 % CI; 6.4-384.6]. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high prevalence of oral diseases among FSW in Abidjan. HIV infection was common and significantly associated with periodontal diseases and oral-mucosal lesions. There is a need to integrate regular screening and treatment of oral lesions into the medical follow-up of FSW along with strategies for HIV prevention."

PURPOSE: This study was aimed to identify the factors affecting the treatment and control of hypertension in early adulthood by gender in South Korea. METHODS: This secondary data analysis study used a data set from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) 19-44 years old and (b) having an indicator of hypertension (systolic blood pressure >= 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure >= 90 mmHg, or taking antihypertensive drugs). Seven hundred eighty participants were included in this study. The odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were derived using composite-sample multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: In men, age, marital status, family history of hypertension, treatment of hyperlipidemia, abdominal obesity, high-sodium diet, cholesterol, and aerobic exercise were found to be associated with hypertension treatment and control. In women, age, employment status, cardiovascular risk factors, body mass index, high-sodium diet, and drinking were found to be associated with hypertension treatment and control. CONCLUSIONS: The factors affecting the treatment and control of hypertension differed between the two genders. Therefore, healthcare providers should consider the differences in the factors between the two genders in early adulthood. To improve the treatment and control of hypertension, the guidelines for treatment interventions and management should be gender-specific from early adulthood. Nurses should actively suggest health-related behavioral modifications such as performing aerobic exercise for young adult men and reducing alcohol consumption for women."

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) 19-44 years old and (b) having an indicator of hypertension (systolic blood pressure >= 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure >= 90 mmHg, or taking antihypertensive drugs). Seven hundred eighty participants were included in this study. The odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were derived using composite-sample multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: In men, age, marital status, family history of hypertension, treatment of hyperlipidemia, abdominal obesity, high-sodium diet, cholesterol, and aerobic exercise were found to be associated with hypertension treatment and control. In women, age, employment status, cardiovascular risk factors, body mass index, high-sodium diet, and drinking were found to be associated with hypertension treatment and control. CONCLUSIONS: The factors affecting the treatment and control of hypertension differed between the two genders. Therefore, healthcare providers should consider the differences in the factors between the two genders in early adulthood. To improve the treatment and control of hypertension, the guidelines for treatment interventions and management should be gender-specific from early adulthood. Nurses should actively suggest health-related behavioral modifications such as performing aerobic exercise for young adult men and reducing alcohol consumption for women."

BACKGROUND: In India, tobacco use during pregnancy is not routinely addressed during antenatal care. We measured the association between tobacco use and anemia in low-income pregnant women, and identified ways to integrate tobacco cessation into existing antenatal care at primary health centers. METHODS: We conducted an observational study using structured interviews with antenatal care clinic patients (n = 100) about tobacco use, anemia, and risk factors such as consumption of iron rich foods and food insecurity. We performed blood tests for serum cotinine, hemoglobin and ferritin. We conducted in-depth interviews with physicians (n = 5) and auxiliary nurse midwives (n = 5), and focus groups with community health workers (n = 65) to better understand tobacco and anemia control services offered during antenatal care. RESULTS: We found that 16% of patients used tobacco, 72% were anemic, 41% had iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and 29% were food insecure. Regression analysis showed that tobacco use (OR = 14.3; 95%CI = 2.6, 77.9) and consumption of green leafy vegetables (OR = 0.6; 95%CI = 0.4, 0.9) were independently associated with IDA, and tobacco use was not associated with consumption of iron-rich foods or household food insecurity. Clinics had a system for screening, treatment and follow-up care for anemic and iron-deficient antenatal patients, but not for tobacco use. Clinicians and community health workers were interested in integrating tobacco screening and cessation services with current maternal care services such as anemia control. Tobacco users wanted help to quit. CONCLUSION: It would be worthwhile to assess the feasibility of integrating antenatal tobacco screening and cessation services with antenatal care services for anemia control, such as screening and guidance during clinic visits and cessation support during home visits."

Numerous studies have identified the various fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) genetic variants associated with obesity and its metabolic consequences; however, the impact of dietary factors on these associations remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between FTO single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), daily macronutrient intake, and obesity and its metabolic consequences. From 1549 Caucasian subjects of Polish origin, genotyped for the FTO SNPs (rs3751812, rs8044769, rs8050136, and rs9939609), 819 subjects were selected for gene-diet interaction analysis. Anthropometric measurements were performed and total body fat content and distribution, blood glucose and insulin concentration during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and lipid profile were determined. Macronutrient intake was analyzed based on three-day food records, and daily physical activity levels were evaluated using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Long Form (IPAQ-LF). Our study shows that carriers of the GG genotype of rs3751812 presented lower body weight, body mass index (BMI), total body fat content, and hip and waist circumference and presented lower obesity-related markers if more than 48% of daily energy intake was derived from carbohydrates and lower subcutaneous and visceral fat content when energy intake derived from dietary fat did not exceed 30%. Similar results were observed for rs8050136 CC genotype carriers. We did not notice any significant differences in obesity markers between genotypes of rs8044769, but we did observe a significant impact of diet-gene associations. Body weight and BMI were significantly higher in TT and CT genotype carriers if daily energy intake derived from carbohydrates was less than 48%. Moreover, in TT genotype carriers, we observed higher blood glucose concentration while fasting and during the OGTT test if more than 18% of total energy intake was derived from proteins. In conclusion, our results indicate that daily macronutrient intake may modulate the impact of FTO genetic SNPs on obesity and obesity-related metabolic consequences."

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Oxidative stress and inflammation are proposed to mediate kidney diseases that occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We examined the hypothesis that alpha-lipoic acid (LA) prevents renal injury in a mouse model of sleep apnea. METHODS: Twenty male mice received either intermittent hypoxia (IH) or intermittent air (IA) with or without a LA-enriched diet for 60 days. Plasma and urine samples were collected at the end of study, and kidneys were harvested for protein analysis. RESULTS: Animals in the IH + LA group had lower levels (p < 0.05) of plasma oxidative stress (8-isoprostane) and inflammation (TNF-alpha). Renal oxidative stress was also reduced in mice in the IH + LA (p < 0.05) compared with IH-exposed mice that were fed regular diet. Renal cellular apoptosis and tubular injury were reduced in the IH + LA group. Treatment with LA attenuated IH-induced glomerular hypertrophy and increased albuminuria. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with LA prevents IH-induced renal injury in mice. LA may be a potential therapy for reducing renal dysfunction in patients with OSA. LA can also increase oxidative stress in healthy animals."

Plasma and urine samples were collected at the end of study, and kidneys were harvested for protein analysis. RESULTS: Animals in the IH + LA group had lower levels (p < 0.05) of plasma oxidative stress (8-isoprostane) and inflammation (TNF-alpha). Renal oxidative stress was also reduced in mice in the IH + LA (p < 0.05) compared with IH-exposed mice that were fed regular diet. Renal cellular apoptosis and tubular injury were reduced in the IH + LA group. Treatment with LA attenuated IH-induced glomerular hypertrophy and increased albuminuria. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with LA prevents IH-induced renal injury in mice. LA may be a potential therapy for reducing renal dysfunction in patients with OSA. LA can also increase oxidative stress in healthy animals."

BACKGROUND: Rodents with deficiency of or resistance to the proopiomelanocortin-derived peptide gamma-melanocyte stimulating hormone (gamma-MSH) develop marked salt-sensitive hypertension. We asked whether this hypertension was accompanied by abnormal glucose metabolism. METHODS: gamma-MSH-deficient Pc2(-/-) mice, and resistant Mc3r(-/-) mice were studied acutely for measurement of blood pressure and glucose and insulin concentrations after > or =1 week of a high-sodium diet (HSD; 8% NaCl) compared to a normal-sodium diet (NSD; 0.4% NaCl). Mc3r(-/-) also underwent glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test. RESULTS: Both knockout strains were hypertensive and also exhibited fasting hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia on the HSD. Mc3r(-/-) mice on the HSD had impaired glucose tolerance and insulin-mediated glucose disposal compared to wild-type mice on either the HSD or the NSD, or to Mc3r(-/-) mice on the NSD. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate an interaction of interrupted gamma-MSH signaling with the HSD to cause hypertension on the one hand and abnormal glucose metabolism, with the characteristics of insulin resistance, on the other. Further study of the nature of this interaction should provide new insight into the mechanisms by which salt-sensitive hypertension and insulin resistance are linked."

Pavlovian cues associated with junk-foods (caloric, highly sweet, and/or fatty foods), like the smell of brownies, can elicit craving to eat and increase the amount of food consumed. People who are more susceptible to these motivational effects of food cues may have a higher risk for becoming obese. Further, overconsumption of junk-foods leading to the development of obesity may itself heighten attraction to food cues. Here, we used a model of individual susceptibility to junk-foods diet-induced obesity to determine whether there are pre-existing and/or diet-induced increases in attraction to and motivation for sucrose-paired cues (ie, incentive salience or 'wanting'). We also assessed diet- vs obesity-associated alterations in mesolimbic function and receptor expression. We found that rats susceptible to diet-induced obesity displayed heightened conditioned approach prior to the development of obesity. In addition, after junk-food diet exposure, those rats that developed obesity also showed increased willingness to gain access to a sucrose cue. Heightened 'wanting' was not due to individual differences in the hedonic impact ('liking') of sucrose. Neurobiologically, Mu opioid receptor mRNA expression was lower in striatal 'hot-spots' that generate eating or hedonic impact only in those rats that became obese. In contrast, prolonged exposure to junk-food resulted in cross-sensitization to amphetamine-induced locomotion and downregulation of striatal D2R mRNA regardless of the development of obesity. Together these data shed light on individual differences in behavioral and neurobiological consequences of exposure to junk-food diets and the potential contribution of incentive sensitization in susceptible individuals to greater food cue-triggered motivation."

BACKGROUND: Childhood overweight/obesity has become a major public health concern globally because of its adverse health consequences and escalating prevalence. The factors underlying the disease conditions manifested during adulthood commonly originate in childhood. Nepal is going through a transition where under-nutrition co-exists with obesity; however, there is a lack of well-documented information on childhood overweight or obesity in Nepal. This study was carried out to determine the prevalence and associated factors of childhood overweight/obesity among urban primary school children. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May to October of 2017. Behavioral data were collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire with parents of children aged 6-13 years old in grades 1-5 studying in private schools of Lalitpur district in Nepal. Study participants were selected using two-stage cluster random sampling from 10 private schools. Height and weight measurements of 575 children were taken and BMI-for-age-sex was calculated using WHO AnthroPlus. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21. Associated factors were examined using Chi-square tests followed by multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The study found that out of 575 students, 107 (18.6%) were overweight and 41 (7.1%) were obese. Among 328 male children, 62 (19.0%) were overweight and 35 (10.6%) were obese. Likewise, among 247 female children, 45 (18.2%) were overweight and 6 (2.4%) were obese. Male children (aOR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.38-3.53), children of mothers with a high school (aOR = 3.13, 95% CI: 1.39-7.12) or university level of education (aOR = 3.09, 95% CI: 1.23-7.70) and children of mothers in a professional field (aOR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.02-4.05) had a greater likelihood of being overweight/obese. Likewise, students consuming energy-dense less nutrient food (aOR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.66-5.12), lacking active travel to and from school (aOR = 2.38, 95% CI: 1.12-4.79) and those having sedentary behaviors (aOR = 3.01, 95% CI: 1.20-7.29) were likely to be overweight/obese. CONCLUSIONS: More than one-quarter of the children in urban Lalitpur were found to be overweight/obese. High junk food consumption and sedentary activity were found to be significantly associated with childhood overweight/obesity. School health and awareness programs aiming to reduce the intake of energy-dense foods and promote an active lifestyle including active transportation to school among children are imperative. Future studies to objectively measure the type and amount of food intake and physical activity of students are recommended."

OBJECTIVES: The etiology of male breast cancer is obscure, although an excess risk has been associated with Klinefelter syndrome, testicular disorders, benign breast disease including gynecomastia, use of exogenous estrogens, radiation, and a family history of male or female breast cancer. We conducted a case-control study to investigate risk factors further for breast cancer in men. METHODS: Based on data from the 1986 National (United States) Mortality Followback Survey (NMFS) of almost 20,000 deceased adults (age 25 years or over), we compared information obtained from next-of-kin interviews of 178 men who died of breast cancer with that of 512 male controls who died of other causes. Information was obtained on selected demographic and other factors, including diet, exercise, occupation, height and weight, and use of tobacco and alcohol. RESULTS: Increased risks were found for men who were described by their next-of-kin as very overweight (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-5.0). The risks associated with the three upper quartiles of body mass index (BMI) (wt/ht2) were 1.3, 1.6, and 2.3, respectively, with a significant dose-response relationship (P < 0.01). An excess risk was also associated with limited exercise (OR = 1.3, CI = 0.8-2.0). Consumption of red meat was associated with an increased risk, and consumption of fruits and vegetables with a decreased risk, although the trends were not significant. No association was found for tobacco or alcohol use, but an excess risk was associated with higher levels of socioeconomic status (SES) (OR = 1.8, CI = 1.1-3.0).

Information was obtained on selected demographic and other factors, including diet, exercise, occupation, height and weight, and use of tobacco and alcohol. RESULTS: Increased risks were found for men who were described by their next-of-kin as very overweight (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-5.0). The risks associated with the three upper quartiles of body mass index (BMI) (wt/ht2) were 1.3, 1.6, and 2.3, respectively, with a significant dose-response relationship (P < 0.01). An excess risk was also associated with limited exercise (OR = 1.3, CI = 0.8-2.0). Consumption of red meat was associated with an increased risk, and consumption of fruits and vegetables with a decreased risk, although the trends were not significant. No association was found for tobacco or alcohol use, but an excess risk was associated with higher levels of socioeconomic status (SES) (OR = 1.8, CI = 1.1-3.0). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that obesity increases the risk of male breast cancer, possibly through hormonal mechanisms, while dietary factors, physical activity, and SES indicators also deserve further investigation."

BACKGROUND: Leisure-time physical activity has been related with a reduced risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The effects of occupational and commuting physical activity (physical activity at work and on the way to work) on cognitive health are still unclear. This study aimed to clarify the association between work-related physical activity and dementia/AD. METHODS: Participants of the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia (CAIDE) study were derived from random, population-based samples previously studied in a survey carried out in 1972, 1977, 1982, or 1987. After an average follow-up of 21 years, 1449 individuals (73%) aged 65 to 79 years participated in the re-examination in 1998. RESULTS: Neither occupational [Odds Ratio (OR) 1.45; 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 0.66-3.17] nor commuting physical activity (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.10-2.17) were associated with the risk of dementia or AD after adjustments for age, sex, education, follow-up time, locomotor symptoms, main occupation during life, income at midlife, leisure-time physical activity, other subtype of work-related physical activity, ApoE genotype, vascular disorders and the smoking status. There were also no interactions between work-related physical activity and the ApoE epsilon4 genotype, leisure-time physical activity or sex. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, work-related physical activity was not found to be sufficient to protect against dementia and AD later in life. The lack of effect might be partly due to a residual confounding. Nevertheless, physical activity during leisure-time may be beneficial even for people who are physically active at work or when commuting."

The treatment of food allergies is logically based on strict elimination of causative allergens. While it is easy to eliminate food which is infrequently consumed, it is more difficult to manage an allergy involving regularly consumed foods, especially where patients have to eat away from home for professional reasons. The creation of elimination diets for milk, eggs, and mould and yeast allergies is discussed. In raw food and vegetable allergy the act of cooking is often sufficient to denature the allergen as it is unstable to heat. Follow-up investigations show that some 50% of children achieve cure spontaneously by strict elimination diet, especially in regard to milk allergy. In our own 173 (mainly adult) patients with food allergy, some 2/3 reported after 3-5 years that a strict elimination diet had to be followed, since otherwise prompt relapse of allergic symptoms was noted. About 1/3 of patients, mainly with milk, cheese or egg allergy, can hope for spontaneous desensitization by appropriate diet. This is demonstrated by a case history with disappearance of IgE antibodies. Should this fail to occur, oral desensitization with milk or egg-white extracts offers an effective therapy. The practice of hyposensitization with foodstuffs is illustrated by examples and tabulation of immunologic parameters. In raw food or vegetable allergy, which is often associated with birch or mugwort pollinosis, improvement or even complete cure can be expected in about 1/3 of cases by systematic desensitization of pollinosis. On the other hand, the therapy and prognosis of food allergy involving extreme and polyvalent sensitivities, especially to spices, or with multifactorially induced symptoms, is more problematic. In these cases a strict elimination diet should be followed by continuous prophylactic/symptomatic treatment with antianaphylactic substances such as cromoglicinic acid (Nalcrom) - especially in gastrointestinal food allergies - or with ketotifen (Zaditen) or oxatomide (Tinset) in hematogenically released shock fragments. Patients with severe anaphylactic reactions after meals should, by analogy with patients with hymenoptera allergy, carry an emergency kit containing an adrenaline spray (Medihaler-Epi), a soluble corticosteroid (e.g. Betnesol) and anthistaminic drugs (e.g. Tavegyl, Teldane)."

Cutaneous leishmaniasis is the most common form of leishmaniasis in humans. The disease is caused by several species, such as Leishmania mexicana, a protozoa parasite. Several major risk factors are associated with this disease, including poverty, poor housing, inadequate domestic hygiene, malnutrition, mobility, and occupational exposure. Solar radiation (UVB) has not been considered a risk factor because there is no scientific evidence demonstrating a correlation with increased susceptibility to cutaneous leishmaniasis. In this study, the shaved skin of the back of C57BL/6 mice was irradiated with 24.2 mJ/cm(2) of UVB. A delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction was used to assess UV-induced immune suppression. Skin lesions were quantitated, and parasite burden and the presence of anti-Leishmania mexicana antibodies in serum and germinal centers in draining lymph nodes were determined. We found an increased in the lesion size and parasitic load in UVB-irradiated mice compared to the WT mice and B lymphocyte activation in draining lymph nodes and increased IgG1 production. Our results show an important role of UVB-induced suppression in cutaneous leishmaniasis through local production of IL-10 and systemic IgG1antibodies.

Cigarette smoking was a strong risk factor, but accounted for only about one-fourth of all newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer. Most patients, particularly with adenocarcinoma, were life-long non-smokers. The risks of lung cancer were higher among women reporting tuberculosis and other pre-existing lung diseases. Hormonal factors were suggested by an increased risk associated with late menopause and by a gradient in the risk of adenocarcinoma with decreasing menstrual cycle length, with a 3-fold excess among women who had shorter cycles. Perhaps most intriguing were associations found between lung cancer and measures of exposure to cooking oil vapors. Risks increased with the numbers of meals cooked by either stir frying, deep frying or boiling; with the frequency of smokiness during cooking; and with the frequency of eye irritation during cooking. Use of rapeseed oil, whose volatiles following high-temperature cooking may be mutagenic, was also reported more often by the cancer patients.

A case-control study involving interviews with 672 female lung cancer patients and 735 population-based controls was conducted to investigate the high rates of lung cancer, notably adenocarcinoma, among women in Shanghai. Cigarette smoking was a strong risk factor, but accounted for only about one-fourth of all newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer. Most patients, particularly with adenocarcinoma, were life-long non-smokers. The risks of lung cancer were higher among women reporting tuberculosis and other pre-existing lung diseases. Hormonal factors were suggested by an increased risk associated with late menopause and by a gradient in the risk of adenocarcinoma with decreasing menstrual cycle length, with a 3-fold excess among women who had shorter cycles. Perhaps most intriguing were associations found between lung cancer and measures of exposure to cooking oil vapors. Risks increased with the numbers of meals cooked by either stir frying, deep frying or boiling; with the frequency of smokiness during cooking; and with the frequency of eye irritation during cooking.

Background : Dental caries is a major public health problem and the most widespread chronic disease to affect individuals throughout their lifetime. Little information exists about the prevalence of dental caries among Egyptian adults. Therefore, this study investigated the dental caries experience among Egyptian adults in correlation with different risk factors. Methods : A total of 359 Egyptian adults (age range, 18-74 years) were examined over a period of 3 months, starting on the 15 (th) of November 2017 until the 13 (th) of January 2018. Socio-demographic data, brushing frequency, body mass index (BMI) and eating habits were recorded and collected using a questionnaire. Dental examination was performed using the Decayed, Missing and Filled tooth (DMFT) index. Results : In total, 86.63% of participants had dental caries experience. Of the participants, 60.45%, 48.47% and 55.43% had at least one decayed, missing and filled tooth, respectively. The mean number of decayed, missing, filled or DMFT for the whole sample were 2.4+/-3.6, 1.98+/-3.99, 1.79+/-2.45, 6.09+/-5.7, respectively. Decayed teeth were inversely correlated with socio-economic status (SES), education level, brushing frequency and milk consumption and positively correlated with grains, junk food and soda drinks consumption. Missing teeth were inversely correlated with SES, education level and brushing frequency, while positively correlated with age, BMI and caffeinated drink consumption. Conversely, filled teeth were positively correlated with age, BMI, SES and education level, while negatively correlated with grains and sugars in drinks. Conclusion : The present study clarifies that age, BMI, SES, education level and brushing frequency are risk factors significantly associated with dental caries prevalence amongst Egyptian adults. Egyptian adults' dietary habits might lead to obesity, which indirectly causes dental caries rather than directly as in children."

Methods : A total of 359 Egyptian adults (age range, 18-74 years) were examined over a period of 3 months, starting on the 15 (th) of November 2017 until the 13 (th) of January 2018. Socio-demographic data, brushing frequency, body mass index (BMI) and eating habits were recorded and collected using a questionnaire. Dental examination was performed using the Decayed, Missing and Filled tooth (DMFT) index. Results : In total, 86.63% of participants had dental caries experience. Of the participants, 60.45%, 48.47% and 55.43% had at least one decayed, missing and filled tooth, respectively. The mean number of decayed, missing, filled or DMFT for the whole sample were 2.4+/-3.6, 1.98+/-3.99, 1.79+/-2.45, 6.09+/-5.7, respectively. Decayed teeth were inversely correlated with socio-economic status (SES), education level, brushing frequency and milk consumption and positively correlated with grains, junk food and soda drinks consumption. Missing teeth were inversely correlated with SES, education level and brushing frequency, while positively correlated with age, BMI and caffeinated drink consumption. Conversely, filled teeth were positively correlated with age, BMI, SES and education level, while negatively correlated with grains and sugars in drinks. Conclusion : The present study clarifies that age, BMI, SES, education level and brushing frequency are risk factors significantly associated with dental caries prevalence amongst Egyptian adults. Egyptian adults' dietary habits might lead to obesity, which indirectly causes dental caries rather than directly as in children."

OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of diabetes management and sleep duration with glycemic control in youth with type 1 diabetes mellitus. PATIENTS/METHODS: 111 participants (mean age = 13.59 +/- 2.11 years, 52.3% male, 50.5% non-white) wore actigraphy (average duration = 5.5 nights) and completed self-reported daily sleep diaries (average duration = 5.3 nights). Parents and participants each completed the Diabetes Management Scale (DMS) as part of a neurobehavioral evaluation. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and daily frequency of self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) were collected from patient medical records. RESULTS: Youth with T1DM slept below the recommended amount of sleep for this age group (M = 7.45, SD = 0.74), which is approximately 9 h for school aged youth. They were in poor glycemic control with an average HbA1c of 9.11% (SD = 1.95) and their SMBG frequency was 4.9 (SD = 2.71). Average sleep duration from actigraphy was significantly correlated with average SMBG frequency and inversely related to HbA1c, indicating that less sleep was associated with worse management and glycemic control. When entered into a mediation model, diabetes management (SMBG frequency) completely mediated the relationship between sleep duration and glycemic control (HbA1c). Different sleep parameters of sleep quality, time to sleep, and sleep consistency also significantly correlated with HbA1c, SMBG, and parent and child-reports of various aspects of diabetes management. In particular, later bedtimes and a greater social jetlag predicted worse glycemic control. CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of sleep deprived and poorly controlled youth with T1DM, diabetes management was an intermediary factor between sleep duration and glycemic control. Additional analyses of data supported circadian influences on glycemic control. These results highlight the importance of addressing sleep duration, quality, and consistency as part of routine diabetes management in this population."

RLS	sleep disruption	Causes	22341907	train	T19	T18	1907:1910	1887:1903	"Leg movements during wakefulness in restless legs syndrome: time structure and relationships with periodic leg movements during sleep. 
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Approximately one third of patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS) also show periodic leg movements (PLM) during relaxed wake fulness (PLMW). In contrast with the large amount of data published on periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS), PLMW have received less attention from the scientific community. The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlations/differences of time-structure and response to a dopamine-agonist between PLMW and PLMS in patients with RLS. METHODS: Ninety idiopathic RLS patients and 28 controls were recruited. Subjects underwent clinical and neurophysiological evaluation, hematological screening, and one or two consecutive full-night polysomnographic studies. A subset of patients received 0.25mg of pramipexole or placebo before the second recording. Polysomnographic recordings were scored and LM activity was analyzed during sleep and during the epochs of wakefulness occurring during the first recording hour. RESULTS: RLS patients had higher LM activity during wakefulness than controls, but with a similar periodicity. Even if correlated, the ability of the PLMW index to predict the PLMS index decreased with increasing LM activity. Intermovement intervals during wakefulness showed one peak only at approximately 4s, gradually decreasing with increasing interval in both patients and controls. The effect of pramipexole was very limited and involved the small periodic portion of LM activity during wakefulness. CONCLUSIONS: PLMW index and PLMS index were correlated; however, the magnitude of this correlation was not sufficient to suggest that PLMW can be good predictors of PLMS. Short-interval LM activity during wakefulness and sleep might be linked to the severity of sleep disruption in RLS patients and the differences between their features obtained during wakefulness or sleep might be relevant for the diagnosis of sleep disturbances in RLS."

A wider array of treatments are needed for people with substance abuse disorders. Some psychedelic compounds have been assessed as potential substance abuse treatments with promising results. MDMA may also help treat substance abuse based on shared features with psychedelic compounds and recent reports indicating that MDMAassisted psychotherapy can reduce symptoms of PTSD. Narrative reports and data from early investigations found that some people reduced or eliminated their substance use after receiving MDMA, especially in a therapeutic setting. MDMA is a potent monoamine releaser with sympathomimetic effects that may indirectly activate 5-HT2A receptors. It increases interpersonal closeness and prosocial feelings, potentially through oxytocin release. Findings suggest that ecstasy, material represented as containing MDMA, is associated with deleterious long-term effects after heavy lifetime use, including fewer serotonin transporter sites and impaired verbal memory. Animal and human studies demonstrate moderate abuse liability for MDMA, and this effect may be of most concern to those treating substance abuse disorders. However, subjects who received MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in two recent clinical studies were not motivated to seek out ecstasy, and tested negative in random drug tests during follow-up in one study. MDMA could either directly treat neuropharmacological abnormalities associated with addiction, or it could indirectly assist with the therapeutic process or reduce symptoms of comorbid psychiatric conditions, providing a greater opportunity to address problematic substance use. Studies directly testing MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in people with active substance abuse disorder may be warranted."

PTSD	MDMAassisted psychotherapy	Treats	23627786	train	T19	T22	429:433	379:405	"Can MDMA play a role in the treatment of substance abuse? 
A wider array of treatments are needed for people with substance abuse disorders. Some psychedelic compounds have been assessed as potential substance abuse treatments with promising results. MDMA may also help treat substance abuse based on shared features with psychedelic compounds and recent reports indicating that MDMAassisted psychotherapy can reduce symptoms of PTSD. Narrative reports and data from early investigations found that some people reduced or eliminated their substance use after receiving MDMA, especially in a therapeutic setting. MDMA is a potent monoamine releaser with sympathomimetic effects that may indirectly activate 5-HT2A receptors. It increases interpersonal closeness and prosocial feelings, potentially through oxytocin release. Findings suggest that ecstasy, material represented as containing MDMA, is associated with deleterious long-term effects after heavy lifetime use, including fewer serotonin transporter sites and impaired verbal memory. Animal and human studies demonstrate moderate abuse liability for MDMA, and this effect may be of most concern to those treating substance abuse disorders. However, subjects who received MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in two recent clinical studies were not motivated to seek out ecstasy, and tested negative in random drug tests during follow-up in one study. MDMA could either directly treat neuropharmacological abnormalities associated with addiction, or it could indirectly assist with the therapeutic process or reduce symptoms of comorbid psychiatric conditions, providing a greater opportunity to address problematic substance use. Studies directly testing MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in people with active substance abuse disorder may be warranted."

Cooking oil fumes have been suggested to increase the risk of lung cancer in Chinese women by exposing them to mutagenic substances. We investigated the association between lung cancer and locally made rapeseed and linseed oils in a population-based case-control study in Gansu Province, China. Two hundred and thirty-three incident, female lung cancer cases diagnosed from 1994-98 were identified. A control group of 459 women was selected from census lists and were frequency matched on age and prefecture. Interviewers obtained information on cooking practices and cooking oil use. The odds ratio (OR) for lung cancer associated with ever-use of rapeseed oil, alone or in combination with linseed oil, was 1.67 (95% CI 1.0-2.5), compared to use of linseed oil alone.

Anaemia is a persistent problem among young Burkinabe children, yet population-specific information on its determinants is scant. We used baseline data from an evaluation of Helen Keller International's Enhanced Homestead Food Production Program (n=1210 children) to quantify household-, mother-, and child-level factors associated with anaemia in Burkinabe children aged 6-12 months. We used structural equation modelling to assess a theoretical model, which tested four categories of factors: (a) household food security and dietary diversity, (b) household sanitation and hygiene (latrine and poultry access and bednet ownership), (c) maternal factors (anaemia, stress, cleanliness, and health, hygiene and feeding knowledge and practices), and (d) child nutrition and health (iron deficiency (ID), retinol binding protein (RBP), malaria, and inflammation). The model also included household socio-economic status, size, and polygamy; maternal age and education; and child age and sex. Results showed that ID, malaria, and inflammation were the primary direct determinants of anaemia, contributing 15%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. Maternal knowledge directly explained improved child feeding practices and household bednet ownership. Household dietary diversity directly explained 18% of child feeding practices. Additionally, RBP, child age and sex, and maternal anaemia directly predicted child haemoglobin. Our findings suggest that program effectiveness could be increased by addressing the multiple, context-specific contributors of child anaemia. For young Burkinabe children, anaemia control programs that include interventions to reduce ID, malaria, and inflammation should be tested.

gastroenteritis	hand hygiene	Prevents	21717148	train	T3	T22	94:109	179:191	"Suspicion of viral gastroenteritis does improve compliance with hand hygiene. 
PURPOSE: Viral gastroenteritis is common on pediatric wards, increasing the need for adherence with hand hygiene recommendations in order to prevent cross-transmission. Therefore, we investigated hand hygiene reflecting complete work-day activities on pediatric wards and focused on the influence of viral gastroenteritis. There are, so far, no studies representing complete working days on pediatric wards or addressing the influence of viral gastroenteritis. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study (144 h in each group) on hand hygiene behavior in the care for children with and without suspected or proven viral gastroenteritis. RESULTS: We documented 40 and 30 hand hygiene opportunities per patient-day for ward-associated healthcare workers for children with and without viral gastroenteritis, respectively (P = 0.316). Healthcare workers' compliance with hand hygiene recommendations was significantly higher in children with viral gastroenteritis compared to those without, i.e., 72 versus 67% (P = 0.033), especially among physicians, being 92 versus 50% (P = 0.032). Compliance tended to be higher after patient contact than before, especially in the children with gastroenteritis (78 vs. 62%; P = 0.083). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that viral gastroenteritis seemed to increase the number of daily opportunities for hand hygiene and did significantly increase compliance. In particular, this effect was seen after patient contact. Further research might address the awareness of undiagnosed transmissible diseases in order to prevent cross-transmissions."

Cervical cancer-associated high-risk HPVs (hrHPVs) were detectable in most (89%) examined cases of VV-SCC(vagina) and in half (50%) of cases of VV-SCC(vulva) (p < 0.001). In site-specific multivariate logistic regression analyses, statistically significant risk factors for both VV-SCC(vulva) and VV-SCC(vagina) included measures of hrHPV exposure (anogenital warts for VV-SCC(vulva); cervical neoplasia and poor genital hygiene for VV-SCC(vagina)), tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. Furthermore, socioeconomic variables (marital status and years at school) were associated with risk of VV-SCC(vulva). Comparing hrHPV-positive and hrHPV-negative VV-SCCs in polytomous logistic regression analysis revealed that tobacco smoking and cervical neoplasia were significant risk factors only for hrHPV-positive VV-SCCs. Our study shows that VV-SCC(vulva) and VV-SCC(vagina) share measures of prior hrHPV exposure, tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption as statistically significant risk factors. HPV vaccination programs aimed at reducing the burden of cervical cancers are likely to also provide considerable protection against VV-SCCs."

Farmers constitute a large professional group worldwide. In developed countries farms tend to become larger, with a concentration of farm operations. Animal farming has been associated with negative respiratory effects such as work-related asthma and rhinitis. However, being born and raised or working on a farm reduces the risk of atopic asthma and rhinitis later in life. A risk of chronic bronchitis and bronchial obstruction/COPD has been reported in confinement buildings and livestock farmers. This position paper reviews the literature linking exposure information to intensive animal farming and the risk of work-related respiratory diseases and focuses on prevention. Animal farming is associated with exposure to organic dust containing allergens and microbial matter including alive microorganisms and viruses, endotoxins and other factors like irritant gases such as ammonia and disinfectants. These exposures have been identified as specific agents/risk factors of asthma, rhinitis, chronic bronchitis, COPD and reduced FEV1. Published studies on dust and endotoxin exposure in livestock farmers do not show a downward trend in exposure over the last 30 years, suggesting that the workforce in these industries is still overexposed and at risk of developing respiratory disease. In cases of occupational asthma and rhinitis, avoidance of further exposure to causal agents is recommended, but it may not be obtainable in agriculture, mainly due to socio-economic considerations. Hence, there is an urgent need for focus on farming exposure in order to protect farmers and others at work in these and related industries from developing respiratory diseases and allergy."

Farmers constitute a large professional group worldwide. In developed countries farms tend to become larger, with a concentration of farm operations. Animal farming has been associated with negative respiratory effects such as work-related asthma and rhinitis. However, being born and raised or working on a farm reduces the risk of atopic asthma and rhinitis later in life. A risk of chronic bronchitis and bronchial obstruction/COPD has been reported in confinement buildings and livestock farmers. This position paper reviews the literature linking exposure information to intensive animal farming and the risk of work-related respiratory diseases and focuses on prevention. Animal farming is associated with exposure to organic dust containing allergens and microbial matter including alive microorganisms and viruses, endotoxins and other factors like irritant gases such as ammonia and disinfectants. These exposures have been identified as specific agents/risk factors of asthma, rhinitis, chronic bronchitis, COPD and reduced FEV1. Published studies on dust and endotoxin exposure in livestock farmers do not show a downward trend in exposure over the last 30 years, suggesting that the workforce in these industries is still overexposed and at risk of developing respiratory disease.

Farmers constitute a large professional group worldwide. In developed countries farms tend to become larger, with a concentration of farm operations. Animal farming has been associated with negative respiratory effects such as work-related asthma and rhinitis. However, being born and raised or working on a farm reduces the risk of atopic asthma and rhinitis later in life. A risk of chronic bronchitis and bronchial obstruction/COPD has been reported in confinement buildings and livestock farmers. This position paper reviews the literature linking exposure information to intensive animal farming and the risk of work-related respiratory diseases and focuses on prevention. Animal farming is associated with exposure to organic dust containing allergens and microbial matter including alive microorganisms and viruses, endotoxins and other factors like irritant gases such as ammonia and disinfectants. These exposures have been identified as specific agents/risk factors of asthma, rhinitis, chronic bronchitis, COPD and reduced FEV1. Published studies on dust and endotoxin exposure in livestock farmers do not show a downward trend in exposure over the last 30 years, suggesting that the workforce in these industries is still overexposed and at risk of developing respiratory disease. In cases of occupational asthma and rhinitis, avoidance of further exposure to causal agents is recommended, but it may not be obtainable in agriculture, mainly due to socio-economic considerations.

INTRODUCTION: During the last two decades, obesity has proved to be one of the most important problems of public health, and it is considerably more frequent in developed countries, not only in adults, but in children, too. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two thousand three hundred and seventy-four pupils in primary education were considered for the study (1206 boys and 1168 girls). RESULTS: In the population-based study, the proportion of overweight children was 23.9%, of obese children 7.3%, and of those with central obesity 35.5%. The boys were obese in a higher percentage than the girls (9.2% vs. 5.3%, p < 0.05). The obesity rates were gradually reduced as the children were growing older. The nutritional habits which were identified to have a positive association with obesity were the following: skipping breakfast, not consuming fruits and vegetables, and consuming bread and soft drinks. Children's healthy nutrition in school was related to lower rates of generalised and central obesity, while the hours spent watching TV were positively associated with all types of obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Results from the study suggest that a high proportion of children are overweight or obese. Therefore, it is important to adhere to a healthy lifestyle which emphasizes healthy food choices and habits, regular physical activity, and limiting screen time."

BACKGROUND: Hyperglycemia forms a direct and independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular comorbidities in type 2 diabetes. Consumption of sucrose-sweetened soft drinks might further increase the prevalence of hyperglycemic episodes. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess glycemic control in type 2 diabetic subjects and healthy lean and obese control subjects under strict dietary standardization but otherwise free-living conditions, with and without the consumption of soft drinks. DESIGN: Obese type 2 diabetic men (n = 11) and lean (n = 10) and obese (n = 10) normoglycemic male control subjects participated in a randomized crossover study. The subjects were provided with a standardized diet in 2 periods, during which they consumed 250 mL water with or without (control) sucrose (37.5 g) 2 h after breakfast and lunch. Blood glucose concentrations were assessed by continuous glucose monitoring. RESULTS: In the type 2 diabetic subjects, the mean 24-h glucose concentrations were significantly elevated (9.1 +/- 0.6 mmol/L), and hyperglycemia (glucose >10 mmol/L) was evident over 33 +/- 8% (8 +/- 2 h) of a 24-h period (P < 0.01). Hyperglycemia was rarely present in the normoglycemic lean and obese control subjects (5 +/- 2%/24 h for both). Consumption of 75 g sucrose, equivalent to 2 cans of a soft drink, did not further augment the prevalence of hyperglycemia throughout the day in any group. CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetic subjects taking oral blood glucose-lowering medication experience hyperglycemia during most of the daytime. Moderate consumption of sucrose-sweetened beverages does not further increase the prevalence of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetic subjects or in normoglycemic lean or obese men."

Anxiety disorders are the largest group of mental disorders and a leading cause of impairment, implicating in high costs for health systems and society. Effective pharmacological and psychological treatments are available, but a significant fraction of these patients does not respond adequately to these treatments. The objective of this study is to identify neuroimaging findings that could predict response to psychotherapy in anxiety disorders. METHODS: The authors reviewed psychotherapy clinical trials with neuroimaging conducted with patients with anxiety disorders. A systematic review was performed in MEDLINE database through PubMed, the Cochrane Collaboration's Clinical Trials Register (CENTRAL), PsycINFO and Thomson Reuters's Web of Science. RESULTS: From the studies included in this review, 24 investigated anxiety disorder patients, and findings in the amygdala, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula predicted response to psychotherapy in social anxiety disorder. Findings in ACC, hippocampus, insula, dlPFC, amygdala and inferior frontal gyrus (iFG) predicted response to psychotherapy in panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. LIMITATIONS: There was great heterogeneity between the included studies regarding neuroimaging techniques and the tasks performed during functional neuroimaging. CONCLUSION: Neuroimaging studies suggest that abnormalities in hippocampus, amygdala, iFG, uncus and areas linked with emotional regulation (dlPFC and ACC), predict a good outcome to psychotherapy in anxiety disorders."

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) with occupational physical activity (OCPA) and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) among working women. METHODS: The prevalence of MetSyn was calculated for 642 working women. Self-report questionnaire was used to determine levels of OCPA and LTPA and other lifestyle factors. Biometric data were directly collected on all women. RESULTS: No direct relationship for OCPA and the MetSyn was determined. Sufficient LTPA however, was significantly associated with lower prevalence of MetSyn. No dose response relationship was determined with PA and MetSyn. The odds of having MetSyn was significantly higher for sedentary workers with insufficient LTPA compared with those achieving sufficient LTPA. The odds for MetSyn were similar among women employed in moderately active or heavy work yet completing insufficient LTPA compared with women doing sufficient LTPA. CONCLUSIONS: For women with sedentary occupations, a sufficient amount of LTPA is essential to reduce the risk of having the MetSyn. Women in moderate to heavy working occupations may be acquiring adequate amounts of PA to avoid having the MetSyn."

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) with occupational physical activity (OCPA) and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) among working women. METHODS: The prevalence of MetSyn was calculated for 642 working women. Self-report questionnaire was used to determine levels of OCPA and LTPA and other lifestyle factors. Biometric data were directly collected on all women. RESULTS: No direct relationship for OCPA and the MetSyn was determined. Sufficient LTPA however, was significantly associated with lower prevalence of MetSyn. No dose response relationship was determined with PA and MetSyn. The odds of having MetSyn was significantly higher for sedentary workers with insufficient LTPA compared with those achieving sufficient LTPA. The odds for MetSyn were similar among women employed in moderately active or heavy work yet completing insufficient LTPA compared with women doing sufficient LTPA. CONCLUSIONS: For women with sedentary occupations, a sufficient amount of LTPA is essential to reduce the risk of having the MetSyn.

PURPOSES: To explore correlates of nocturia, compare sleep quality and glycemic control for women with and without nocturia, and examine relationships of nocturia with sleep quality and glycemic control in women with diabetes. DESIGN: This study was a cross-sectional, correlational study with data collected from 275 women with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify correlates. Chi-squared tests were used to identify candidate variables for the first logistic regression model. A one-way analysis of variance was used to compare sleep quality and glycemic control for women with and those without nocturia. Pearson correlations were used to examine the relationships of nocturia with sleep quality and glycemic control. FINDINGS: Of the 275 participants, 124 (45.1%) had experienced nocturia (at least two voids per night). Waist circumference, parity, time since diagnosis of diabetes, sleep quality, and increased daytime urinary frequency were correlated with nocturia after adjusting for age. Compared to women without nocturia, women who had nocturia reported poorer sleep quality. A significant correlation was found between the number of nocturnal episodes and sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: Nocturia and poor sleep are common among women with diabetes. The multifactorial nature of nocturia supports the delivered management and treatments being targeted to underlying etiologies in order to optimize women's symptom management. Interventions aimed at modifiable correlates may include maintaining a normal body weight and regular physical exercise for maintaining a normal waist circumference, and decreasing caffeine consumption, implementing feasible modifications in sleeping environments and maintaining sleep hygiene to improve sleep quality. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Healthcare professionals should screen for nocturia and poor sleep and offer appropriate nonpharmacological lifestyle management, behavioral interventions, or pharmacotherapy for women with diabetes."

BACKGROUND: An accumulating body of evidence suggests that there is an inverse relationship between the intake of folate (a water-soluble B-vitamin) and the risk of developing breast cancer. Individual variation in the genes involved in the transport of folate, or its metabolism, may affect risk, or may modify the association between folate and breast cancer risk. METHODS: We performed a case-control study to evaluate the association between common polymorphisms in six folate-related genes and the risk of breast cancer in 1,009 breast cancer patients and 907 healthy controls. Study subjects were genotyped for eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these six genes. RESULTS: We observed no association between the MTHFR, RFC, MS and MTRR genotypes and the risk of breast cancer. CONCLUSION: These data do not support the hypothesis that genetic variation in genes involved in the metabolism of folate are implicated in the etiology of breast cancer."

The prevalence of obesity is increasing rapidly worldwide, which is cause for concern because obesity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, reduces life expectancy, and impairs quality of life. A better understanding of the risk factors for obesity is therefore a critical global health concern, and human biologists can play an important role in identifying these risk factors in various populations. The objective of this review is to present the evidence that inadequate sleep may be a novel risk factor associated with increased vulnerability to obesity and associated cardiometabolic disease. Experimental studies have found that short-term sleep restriction is associated with impaired glucose metabolism, dysregulation of appetite, and increased blood pressure. Observational studies have observed cross-sectional associations between short sleep duration (generally <6 h per night) and increased body mass index or obesity, prevalent diabetes, and prevalent hypertension. Some studies also reported an association between self-reported long sleep duration (generally >8 h per night) and cardiometabolic disease. A few prospective studies have found a significant increased risk of weight gain, incident diabetes, and incident hypertension associated with inadequate sleep. Given the potential link between inadequate sleep and obesity, a critical next step is to identify the social, cultural, and environmental determinants of sleep, which would help to identify vulnerable populations. Future human biology research should consider variation in sleep characteristics among different populations and determine whether the associations between sleep and obesity observed in Western populations persist elsewhere."

PURPOSE: It is unclear how dietary intake influences the ovarian cancer. The present paper sets out to systematically review and meta-analyze research on dietary intake to identify cases having high- or low-risk ovarian cancer. METHODS: Scopus, PubMed, and Wiley Online Libraries were searched up to the date November 24, 2019. Two reviewers were requested to independently extract study characteristics and to assess the bias and applicability risks with reference to the study inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses were performed to specify the relationship between dietary intake and the risk of ovarian cancer identifying 97 cohort studies. RESULTS: No significant association was found between dietary intake and risk of ovarian cancer. The results of subgroup analyses indicated that green leafy vegetables (RR = 0.91, 95%, 0.85-0.98), allium vegetables (RR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.64-0.96), fiber (RR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.98), flavonoids (RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.78-0.89) and green tea (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.49-0.76) intake could significantly reduce ovarian cancer risk. Total fat (RR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18), saturated fat (RR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.22), saturated fatty acid (RR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.04-1.36), cholesterol (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.22) and retinol (RR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.00-1.30) intake could significantly increase ovarian cancer risk. In addition, acrylamide, nitrate, water disinfectants and polychlorinated biphenyls were significantly associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. CONCLUSION: These results could support recommendations to green leafy vegetables, allium vegetables, fiber, flavonoids and green tea intake for ovarian cancer prevention."

The results of subgroup analyses indicated that green leafy vegetables (RR = 0.91, 95%, 0.85-0.98), allium vegetables (RR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.64-0.96), fiber (RR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.98), flavonoids (RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.78-0.89) and green tea (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.49-0.76) intake could significantly reduce ovarian cancer risk. Total fat (RR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18), saturated fat (RR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.22), saturated fatty acid (RR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.04-1.36), cholesterol (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.22) and retinol (RR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.00-1.30) intake could significantly increase ovarian cancer risk.

endometrial cancer	shift work	positive_statistical_association	22362059	train	T4	T3	126:144	86:96	"Sleep duration and endometrial cancer risk. 
PURPOSE: Recent data indicate that night shift work is associated with increased endometrial cancer risk, perhaps through a pathway involving lower melatonin production. Melatonin is an antiestrogenic hormone, with production in a circadian pattern that is dependent on presence of dark at night. Sleep duration is positively associated with melatonin production and may be an indicator of melatonin levels in epidemiologic studies. METHODS: We evaluated associations between self-reported sleep duration and endometrial cancer risk using publicly available prospective data on 48,725 participants in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, among whom 452 adjudicated incident cases of endometrial cancer were diagnosed over approximately 7.5 years of follow-up. Sleep duration was self-reported at baseline. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for endometrial cancer risk with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: Most women reported sleeping <= 6 (33.3%) or 7 (38.5%) h each night; fewer reported sleeping 8 (23.4%) or >= 9 (4.8%) h each night. In adjusted analyses, there was an indication of reduced risk associated with longer sleep duration, though no statistically significant association was observed. Women who slept >= 9 h had a nonsignificant reduced risk of endometrial cancer compared with women who slept <= 6 h (HR = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.51-1.46). CONCLUSIONS: We found weak evidence of an association between sleep duration and endometrial cancer risk. Self-reported sleep duration may not adequately represent melatonin levels, thus further studies utilizing urinary melatonin levels are necessary to establish the mechanism by which night shift work increases endometrial cancer risk."

OBJECTIVES: To explore the associations of hypertension and coronary heart disease (CHD) with use of biomass fuel for cooking. DESIGN: Comparative cross-sectional study. SETTING: Rural villages in Sindh, Pakistan. PARTICIPANTS: Women aged >=40 years who had used biomass fuel for cooking for at least the last year (n=436), and a comparison group (n=414) who had cooked only with non-biomass fuel during the last year were recruited through door-to-door visits.

CHD was assessed by three measures: history of angina (Rose angina questionnaire), previous history of 'heart attack', and definite or probable changes of CHD on ECG. Potentially confounding risk factors were ascertained by questionnaire and anthropometry. Associations of hypertension and CHD with use of biomass and other risk factors were assessed by logistic regression, and summarised by ORs with 95% CIs. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, there was no association of hypertension (OR: 1.0, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.4) angina (OR: 1.0, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.4), heart attack (OR: 1.2, 95% 0.7 to 2.2) or ECG changes of CHD (OR: 0.8, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.2) with current use of biomass for cooking.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the prospective association between eating disorders, disordered eating behaviors, and sleep disturbances in young adults. METHODS: We used prospective cohort data of young adults aged 18-26 from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 12,082). Self-reported exposures of interest (at 18-26 years) included (1) an eating disorder diagnosis proxy; disordered eating behaviors such as (2) restrictive eating behaviors including fasting/skipping meals, (3) compensatory behaviors including vomiting, laxatives/diuretics, or weight loss pills; and (4) loss of control/overeating.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes are occurring at epidemic rates in the United States and many parts of the world. The ""obesity epidemic"" appears to have emerged largely from changes in our diet and reduced physical activity. An important but not well-appreciated dietary change has been the substantial increase in the amount of dietary fructose consumption from high intake of sucrose and high fructose corn syrup, a common sweetener used in the food industry. A high flux of fructose to the liver, the main organ capable of metabolizing this simple carbohydrate, perturbs glucose metabolism and glucose uptake pathways, and leads to a significantly enhanced rate of de novo lipogenesis and triglyceride (TG) synthesis, driven by the high flux of glycerol and acyl portions of TG molecules from fructose catabolism. These metabolic disturbances appear to underlie the induction of insulin resistance commonly observed with high fructose feeding in both humans and animal models. Fructose-induced insulin resistant states are commonly characterized by a profound metabolic dyslipidemia, which appears to result from hepatic and intestinal overproduction of atherogenic lipoprotein particles. Thus, emerging evidence from recent epidemiological and biochemical studies clearly suggests that the high dietary intake of fructose has rapidly become an important causative factor in the development of the metabolic syndrome. There is an urgent need for increased public awareness of the risks associated with high fructose consumption and greater efforts should be made to curb the supplementation of packaged foods with high fructose additives. The present review will discuss the trends in fructose consumption, the metabolic consequences of increased fructose intake, and the molecular mechanisms leading to fructose-induced lipogenesis, insulin resistance and metabolic dyslipidemia."

A sample of participants of the Rotterdam Study (n = 1,016) aged 55-75 years who were not known to have diabetes mellitus underwent an oral glucose tolerance test. Physical activity was assessed by means of a self-administered questionnaire and expressed as time spent on activities per week. Associations with the prevalence of IGT and nDM were assessed by logistic regression analysis after adjustment for age, body mass index, waist-hip ratio, family history of diabetes, and smoking. A total of 745 subjects had normal glucose tolerance, 153 IGT, and 118 nDM. The total amount of time spent on physical activity decreased with increasing glucose intolerance. Adjusted for main confounders, vigorous activities such as bicycling (men: odds ratio (OR) = 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14-0.49; women: OR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.18-0.78) and sports (men: OR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.11-0.74) showed an inverse association with the presence of nDM. For IGT, the associations pointed in the same direction but did not reach statistical significance. These results indicate that physical inactivity and glucose intolerance are associated among older adults similar to the way they are associated among middle-aged adults."

migraine	social media	Statistically_associated	31219049	train	T21	T22	1719:1727	1729:1741	"Not Just a Headache: Qualitative Study About Web-Based Self-Presentation and Social Media Use by People With Migraine. 
BACKGROUND: To help with a long-term but invisible medical condition such as migraine, many people seek information and support on social media. The effect of using social media for people with migraine is not fully understood and remains to be investigated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe how people with migraine use social media and how social media use affects their identity and sense of self. METHODS: A total of 20 participants who experienced migraine were recruited via migraine-specific charities. Semistructured interviews were conducted with questions based on a topic guide. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: People with migraine are using social media to obtain information to better understand their condition and treatment options. Social media offers instant access to continuous information and social support. This exchange of social support and information was viewed as mutually beneficial. Participants viewed social media as an outlet to vent frustrations and validate the migraine experience. Several participants pointed out that the invisible and episodic nature of migraine can lead to societal misunderstanding of the impact and or severity of their condition. Some participants masked their online migraine-related behavior using different sites or closed online groups to control who saw their migraine-related content. Participating in closed social media groups sometimes changed Web-based behavior in other areas of the platform. This illustrates the complex relationship between migraine, social media, and identity. CONCLUSIONS: How migraine is part of an individual's identity and how this is represented online can vary. Social media can provide people who experience migraine with instant and continuous access to support and information, from a group of empathic others with similar lived experiences. Social media is used to validate the illness experience, as well as provide reassurance and help reduce feelings of isolation."

The fumes from cooking oil, similar to cigarette smoke, contain numerous carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aromatic amines, nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, etc. In this study, we examined the association between exposure to cooking oil fumes and the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasm. The study population in this nested case-control study consisted of women above the age of 19 years living in Chia-Yi County, located in the southwestern Taiwan, who had received pap smear screening between October, 1999, and December, 2000 (n=32,466). The potential cases were women having lesions greater than cervical intraepithelium neoplasm II (> or =CIN2) reconfirmed by cervical biopsy (n=116). The potential controls (case: control=1:2) were age-matched (+/-2 years) and residence-matched women who had normal pap smears within 6 months of the cases. In total, 100 cases and 197 controls were completely interviewed by public health nurses about cooking methods, ventilation, and other potential risk factors. Women who cooked at home in a kitchen (n=269) without the presence of a fume extractor at least once a week between the ages of 20 and 40 had a 2.29 times higher risk [95% confidence interval (CI)=1.08-4.87] of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasm than those who did not cook once a week in such a kitchen during the same age span, after adjusting for other potential confounders. This finding was further strengthened by the finding that women who did not use the fume extractors had a 2.47 times higher risk (95% CI=1.15-5.32) of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasm than women who cooked in kitchens with fume extractors that were always switched on while cooking. We also found a joint protective effect of fume extractor use among women older than 40 years (n=202) if they used the extractors during both age spans of their lives, ages 20-40 and >40 years. Comparing our findings on women more than 40 years old who used fume extractors during both periods, we found a 2.05-fold greater risk (95% CI=0.86-4.86) for those who used exhaust fans during only one of the two age spans and a 3.46-fold greater risk in those who had not used an exhaust fan for either period (95% CI=1.08-11.10) (trend test, P=0.02).

Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with insulin resistance. However, the association between special stages of OSA [rapid eye movement (REM) sleep] and insulin resistance is not clear. This study was designed to assess the association of the frequency of respiratory events during REM sleep with insulin resistance in adults with suspected OSA. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 4,062 adult participants with suspected OSA who underwent polysomnography in our sleep center between 2009 and 2016 were screened. Polysomnographic variables, biochemical indicators, and physical measurements were collected. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for insulin resistance as assessed by the presence of hyperinsulinemia, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, the fasting insulin resistance index (FIRI), and Bennett's insulin sensitivity index (ISI). Results: The final analyses included 2,899 adults with suspected OSA. Multivariate adjustments, including the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) during non-REM sleep (AHINREM), were performed. The AHI during REM sleep (AHIREM) was found to be independently associated with insulin resistance across increasing AHIREM quartiles. For hyperinsulinemia the ORs (95% CIs) followed the order of 1.340 (1.022, 1.757), 1.210 (0.882, 1.660), and 1.632 (1.103, 2.416). For abnormal HOMA-IR, ORs (95% CIs) were 1.287 (0.998, 1.661), 1.263 (0.933, 1.711), and 1.556 (1.056, 2.293).

Additionally, the results showed that REM sleep duration was independently associated with hyperinsulinemia (OR =0.777, 95% CI: 0.615-0.982; P<0.05). Conclusions: AHIREM was independently associated with hyperinsulinemia and an abnormal HOMA-IR, FIRI, and Bennett's ISI in adults with suspected OSA.

Additionally, the results showed that REM sleep duration was independently associated with hyperinsulinemia (OR =0.777, 95% CI: 0.615-0.982; P<0.05). Conclusions: AHIREM was independently associated with hyperinsulinemia and an abnormal HOMA-IR, FIRI, and Bennett's ISI in adults with suspected OSA. Additionally, REM sleep duration was independently associated with hyperinsulinemia."
social anxiety disorder	psychotherapy	Treats	34739165	train	T5	T3	400:423	212:225	"Potential processes of change in MDMA-Assisted therapy for social anxiety disorder: Enhanced memory reconsolidation, self-transcendence, and therapeutic relationships. 
OBJECTIVE: Researchers have suggested that psychotherapy may be enhanced by the addition of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), particularly in the treatment of disorders wherein interpersonal dysfunction is central, such as social anxiety disorder. We review literature pertaining to three potential processes of change that may be instigated during sessions involving MDMA administration in the treatment of social anxiety disorder. DESIGN: This is a narrative review that integrates research on the etiology and maintenance of social anxiety disorder and mechanisms of action of MDMA to examine how MDMA may enhance psychotherapy outcomes. RESULTS: We first outline how MDMA may enhance memory reconsolidation in social anxiety disorder. We then discuss how MDMA may induce experiences of self-transcendence and self-transcendent emotions such as compassion, love, and awe; and how these experiences may be therapeutic in the context of social anxiety disorder. We subsequently discuss the possibility that MDMA may enhance the strength and effectiveness of the therapeutic relationship which is a robust predictor of outcomes across many disorders as well as a potential key ingredient in treating disorders where shame and social disconnection are central factors. CONCLUSION: We discuss how processes of change may extend beyond the MDMA dosing sessions themselves."

BACKGROUND: Classification of diabetes mellitus is not easily stated in Central Africa using the current diabetes classification of World Health Organization/American Diabetes Association. The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence, classification and risk factors of diabetes mellitus in Kinshasa Hinterland. METHODS: A multilevel and stratified random sample cross-sectional study included 9770 black Africans (4580 men and 5190 women) aged 12 years and above in urban metropolitan (Kinshasa city) and rural (Kikwit) areas. Participants were examined and administered a structured questionnaire and a capillary whole blood glucose test was done. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 46 +/- 15 years. Overall crude and age adjusted prevalences of diabetes were 25% (n = 2472) and 18%, respectively. Using WHO/ADA classification, Type diabetes (80%) was commoner than undetermined form (12%), Type 1B (3.5%), Type 1A (2.5%) and Other specific types (2%). According to plasma insulin and plasma C-peptide levels, participants with undetermined form were classified Type 2 diabetics. Thus, the rate of Type 2 diabetes among diabetics was estimated 92%. Urban location, age, abdominal obesity arterial hypertension, physical inactivity, inappropriate diet (lack of fruits-vegetables, refined sugar, animal fat and protein, starvation, social inequalities, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake were significantly and positively associated with diabetes in general and type 2 diabetes in particular. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of diabetes is due to the unexpected high rates of type 2 diabetes, aging, urbanization, and sedentary lifestyle consequences. The majority of risk factors of diabetes are potentially modifiable by primary prevention."

BACKGROUND: Classification of diabetes mellitus is not easily stated in Central Africa using the current diabetes classification of World Health Organization/American Diabetes Association. The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence, classification and risk factors of diabetes mellitus in Kinshasa Hinterland. METHODS: A multilevel and stratified random sample cross-sectional study included 9770 black Africans (4580 men and 5190 women) aged 12 years and above in urban metropolitan (Kinshasa city) and rural (Kikwit) areas. Participants were examined and administered a structured questionnaire and a capillary whole blood glucose test was done. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 46 +/- 15 years. Overall crude and age adjusted prevalences of diabetes were 25% (n = 2472) and 18%, respectively. Using WHO/ADA classification, Type diabetes (80%) was commoner than undetermined form (12%), Type 1B (3.5%), Type 1A (2.5%) and Other specific types (2%). According to plasma insulin and plasma C-peptide levels, participants with undetermined form were classified Type 2 diabetics. Thus, the rate of Type 2 diabetes among diabetics was estimated 92%. Urban location, age, abdominal obesity arterial hypertension, physical inactivity, inappropriate diet (lack of fruits-vegetables, refined sugar, animal fat and protein, starvation, social inequalities, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake were significantly and positively associated with diabetes in general and type 2 diabetes in particular. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of diabetes is due to the unexpected high rates of type 2 diabetes, aging, urbanization, and sedentary lifestyle consequences.

At present, the only treatment for food allergy is to avoid the allergy-causing food until outgrowing the allergy. Recently, some trials of oral tolerance induction (oral immunotherapy) for milk, egg, or peanut allergy have been reported. We report here the experience of rush specific oral tolerance induction (rush SOTI) for 2 cases, an 8 year-old girl and a 6 year-old boy, with severe wheat allergy. In hospital, the positive reaction to wheat was identified by a double-blind placebo-controlled challenge test, and then the threshold dose of wheat was measured, and rush SOTI was started at the dose below the threshold, ingesting wheat (bread) 5 times a day at 30 minutes interval, increasing the dose by 20% every time. The goal of rush SOTI was set as 5.6 g of wheat protein. The girl achieved the goal on the 10th day, and the boy did on the 8th day. During the course, the girl experienced adverse reactions 9 times and the boy did 6 times, and these were treated with oral antihistamine or inhalation of salbutamol. After leaving hospital, they have been instructed to ingest the maintenance dose of wheat at least twice a week, and they are ingesting wheat without any problems for 6 months or for 3 months. We assume that rush SOTI is a safe and effective maneuver to tolerize children with wheat allergy, as well as egg or peanut allergy."

Objective: To investigate the high-frequency hearing loss (HFHL) of workers in an automobile factory and its influencing factors, so as to provide a scientific basis for occupational health management of noise workers. Methods: From March to July 2019, 2647 workers from an automobile factory were selected as the research objects by cluster sampling method. The basic personal information (such as gender, age, education level, height, weight, etc.) , history of ear disease, the history of detonation, history of exposure to ototoxic drugs, history of exposure to occupational noise, etc., were investigated by questionnaire and occupational health examination. Chi-square test was used to compare the detection rates of HFHL in different populations, and multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the influencing factors of HFHL. Results: The noise level of 2647 individual workers ranged from 75.0 dB (A) to 92.0 dB (A) , with an average of (84.14+/-2.47) dB (A) . The detection rate of HFHL was 17.2% (456/2647) . There were significant differences in the the detection rate of HFHL among workers of different gender, age, educational level, working age, noise exposure level, diabetes history, detonation history, smoking and drinking workers (P<0.05) . Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that male, age >=30 years old, smoking and noise exposure were risk factors for HFHL (P<0.05) . Conclusion: The detection rate of HFHL in automobile factory workers is high. Gender, age, smoking and noise are the influencing factors of HFHL. It is necessary to strengthen the noise control in the workplace and guide workers to choose healthy lifestyle."

Objective: To investigate the high-frequency hearing loss (HFHL) of workers in an automobile factory and its influencing factors, so as to provide a scientific basis for occupational health management of noise workers. Methods: From March to July 2019, 2647 workers from an automobile factory were selected as the research objects by cluster sampling method. The basic personal information (such as gender, age, education level, height, weight, etc.) , history of ear disease, the history of detonation, history of exposure to ototoxic drugs, history of exposure to occupational noise, etc., were investigated by questionnaire and occupational health examination. Chi-square test was used to compare the detection rates of HFHL in different populations, and multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the influencing factors of HFHL. Results: The noise level of 2647 individual workers ranged from 75.0 dB (A) to 92.0 dB (A) , with an average of (84.14+/-2.47) dB (A) . The detection rate of HFHL was 17.2% (456/2647) . There were significant differences in the the detection rate of HFHL among workers of different gender, age, educational level, working age, noise exposure level, diabetes history, detonation history, smoking and drinking workers (P<0.05) . Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that male, age >=30 years old, smoking and noise exposure were risk factors for HFHL (P<0.05) .

OBJECTIVE: To compare the associations between weight status and different forms of physical activity among adolescents. METHODS: We conducted telephone surveys with 1718 New Hampshire and Vermont high school students and their parents as part of a longitudinal study of adolescent health. We surveyed adolescents about their team sports participation, other extracurricular physical activity, active commuting, physical education, recreational activity for fun, screen time, diet quality, and demographics. Overweight/obesity (BMI for age >= 85th percentile) and obesity (BMI for age >= 95 percentile) were based on self-reported height and weight. RESULTS: Overall, 29.0% (n = 498) of the sample was overweight/obese and 13.0% (n = 223) were obese. After adjustments, sports team participation was inversely related to overweight/obesity (relative risk [RR] = 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61, 0.87] for >2 sports teams versus 0) and obesity (RR = 0.61 [95% CI: 0.45, 0.81] for >2 sports teams versus 0). Additionally, active commuting to school was inversely related to obesity (RR = 0.67 [95% CI: 0.45, 0.99] for >3.5 days per week versus 0). Attributable risk estimates suggest obesity prevalence would decrease by 26.1% (95% CI: 9.4%, 42.8%) if all adolescents played on 2 sports teams per year and by 22.1% (95% CI: 0.1%, 43.3%) if all adolescents walked/biked to school at least 4 days per week. CONCLUSIONS: Team sport participation had the strongest and most consistent inverse association with weight status. Active commuting to school may reduce the risk of obesity, but not necessarily overweight, and should be studied further. Obesity prevention programs should consider strategies to increase team sport participation among all students."

This case-control study composed of 73 women with uterine fibroids and 210 women without fibroids. Uterine fibroid cases were confirmed by ultrasound diagnosis or hysterectomy surgery. Information on women's dietary habits, physical activity and stress status were collected with a validated self-administered questionnaire. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) after controlling for age, gravidity and parity. We found that vegetable and fruit intakes and occupational intensity played positive effects on uterine fibroids.

For premenopausal women, vegetable and fruit intakes (OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.9) and occupational intensity (OR = 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1, 0.6) significantly decreased the risk of fibroids; conversely, BMI significantly increased the risk (OR = 1.2; 95% CI: 1.0, 1.4). However, the associations for postmenopausal women were not significant. Our findings suggested protective roles for vegetable and fruit intakes and occupational intensity on uterine fibroids, and supported the hypothesis that high BMI only increased the risk of uterine fibroids in premenopausal women."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of pickled food,fried food and smoked food combined with smoking and alcohol drinking with lung cancer. METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted. A total of 1902 cases(24-90 years old) diagnosed in the Union Hospital and First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University and Fuzhou General Hospital of Nanjing Military Region and 2026(23-87 years old) controls matched healthy populaition for age(+/-3 ages) and gender from January 2006 to December 2013. Unconditional Logistic regression was used to analyze the combined effects and interactions of pickled food, fried food and smoked food with smoking and drinking, and to explore their relationship with the risk of lung cancer. RESULTS: The result of unconditional Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that fried food and smoked food were risk factors of lung cancer. Compare with the people whose fired food intake<3 times/week, the people whose fired food intake >=3 times/week had a 2. 954-folds increased lung cancer risk(95% CI 2. 065-4. 226). Compare with the people whose smoked food intake<3 times/week, the people whose smoked food intake >=3 times/week had a 6. 774-folds increased lung cancer risk(95% CI 3. 309-13. 866). The result of combined effect demonstrated that compare with the non-smoking drinker whose food intake score was 0, the smoking drinker whose food intake score was 1 had a 2. 108-folds increased lung cancer risk(95% CI 1. 551-2. 865); compare with the non-smoking drinker whose food intake score was 0, the smoking drinker whose food intake score >=2 had a 2. 191-folds increased lung cancer risk(95% CI 1. 377-3. 484).

Compare with the people whose smoked food intake<3 times/week, the people whose smoked food intake >=3 times/week had a 6. 774-folds increased lung cancer risk(95% CI 3. 309-13. 866). The result of combined effect demonstrated that compare with the non-smoking drinker whose food intake score was 0, the smoking drinker whose food intake score was 1 had a 2. 108-folds increased lung cancer risk(95% CI 1. 551-2. 865); compare with the non-smoking drinker whose food intake score was 0, the smoking drinker whose food intake score >=2 had a 2. 191-folds increased lung cancer risk(95% CI 1. 377-3. 484). The result of interaction analysis demenstrated that intake of two or three kinds of risky food(>=1 time/week) increased the risk of lung cancer(OR = 1. 309, 95% CI 1. 010-1. 696) and it was more dangerous to smokers and drinkers. As for smokers, intake of two or three kinds of risky food was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in an exposure-response manner(Ptrend<0. 001). CONCLUSION: The intake of fried food and smoked food are independent risk factors of lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: Although mantle radiation (ie, extended field radiation) represented the standard of care in the past for Hodgkin disease, contemporary treatment of lymphoma consists of a multimodal approach with chemotherapy. Patients who were exposed to mantle radiation have a higher risk of breast cancer and are more susceptible to postoperative complications after breast reconstruction due to radiation. In this study, we present postoperative outcomes in patients with a history of mantle radiation who underwent mastectomy and breast reconstruction. METHODS: All patients at Stanford University Medical Center between January 2006 and December 2012 with a history of Hodgkin lymphoma treated with mantle radiation who received breast reconstruction were identified. A retrospective chart review was conducted analyzing patient demographics, history of Hodgkin treatment, type of reconstruction, follow-up, and complications. Complications were further classified into medical complications, donor-site complications, and recipient-site complications. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with a history of Hodgkin disease and mantle radiation received breast reconstruction. The average age of the patients at their mastectomy was 46 (33-60) years, with the average age at the time of their mantle radiation of 20.5 (10-33) years with an average interval of radiation to breast cancer treatment of 24.8 (16-38) years. There were five unilateral and 11 bilateral reconstructions. All patients had immediate reconstruction with tissue expanders (14 patients) or autologous tissue (one muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous and one transverse upper gracilis flap). Eleven (69%) patients had postoperative complications. In the patients who had tissue expander reconstruction, there was an overall complication rate of 64%, which included capsular contracture (n=5, 56%), mastectomy flap necrosis (n=5, 56%), cellulitis (n=4, 44%), seroma (n=3, 33%), hematoma (n=1, 11%), and chronic pain (n=1, 11%). Three (two unilateral and one bilateral) tissue expander infections required removal of the expander and delayed reconstruction with a latissimus dorsi flap, whereas one patient with chronic pain and capsular contracture required a muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous for a unilateral implant failure. CONCLUSIONS: Although the risk of complications associated with preoperative radiation is well documented, physicians and patients should be cognizant of the increased risk of complications after mantle radiation as it represents a unique modality of radiation exposure."

BACKGROUND: Folates are essential cofactors in metabolic pathways that facilitate biological methylation and nucleotide synthesis, and therefore have widespread effects on health and diseases. Although obesity is prevalent worldwide, few studies have investigated how obesity interacts with folate status. OBJECTIVE: Based on data from the NHANES, this study aims to examine the association between body mass index (BMI) and obesity-related metabolic factors with blood folate status. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 3767 adults from the NHANES (2003-2006) was used as the study population. Regression analyses, with and without adjustment for demographic factors and dietary intakes, were performed to examine associations between BMI and metabolic factors with serum and RBC folate. RESULTS: The results indicate serum folate concentrations were lower in obese groups compared to the desirable BMI and overweight categories, paralleling lower intakes in this group. In contrast, RBC folate increased incrementally with BMI. Regression analyses demonstrated an inverse relation between BMI and serum folate but a positive relation for RBC folate (P < 0.01). Waist circumference, serum triglycerides, and fasting plasma glucose each displayed significant positive relations with RBC folate (P < 0.01), although relations with serum folate were not significant and consistent. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, obesity is associated with decreased serum folate, which parallels decreased folate intakes. In contrast, obesity is positively associated with RBC folate. Therefore, RBC folate, in addition to serum folate, should also be considered as a critical biomarker for folate status, especially in the obese population. Future research is needed to understand how obesity differentially alters serum and RBC folate status because they are associated with a variety of medical complications."

OBJECTIVE: To describe the relationships between sleep duration, dietary patterns and overweight/obesity among adolescents in Xuzhou, and to develop prevention and intervention strategies for adolescent-obesity. METHODS: Data of 3 103 boys and girls from 5 junior high schools were analyzed. Self-reported information on duration of sleep, dietary patterns, physical activities and time spent on watching video/audio program were assessed and physique data was also collected. Descriptive statistics, multiple liner regression and logistic regression models were used. RESULTS: The prevalence rates on overweight and obesity in boys were 23.5% and 22.5% , and in girls were 18.1% and 11.9%, respectively. Proportions of insufficient sleep (<8 h/d) in boys appeared 28.1% and in girls as 33.0% . From logistic regression analysis revealed that there appeared risk on the prevalence of overweight and obesity in boys who had sleep duration <7 h/d [OR(95% CI):1.72 (1.08-2.74)], but no significant association was found between duration of sleep and overweight/ obesity in girls. After adjusting on age, levels of parental education, family income, physical activities, time spent on watching video/audio programs, and weight status, boys who had sleep duration less than 7 h/d would have the odds ratio of 1.69 (1.10-2.73), for the likelihood of increasing the frequency of eating snacks compared to their counterparts who had sleep duration of >= 8 h/d. CONCLUSION: The Shortened duration of sleep seemed an independent risk factor on overweight/obesity among male adolescents, and it was associated with the increased frequency of eating snacks. Data from our study showed that the dietary patterns might play a role in the association between duration of sleep and overweight/ obesity, among male adolescents."

OBJECTIVE: Nicotine dependence frequently co-occurs with subsyndromal and pathological levels of gambling. The relationship of nicotine dependence, levels of gambling pathology, and other psychiatric disorders, however, is incompletely understood. METHOD: To use nationally representative data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions to examine the influence of DSM-IV nicotine dependence on the association between pathological gambling severities and other psychiatric disorders. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 43,093 adults living in households and group-quarters in the United States. The main outcome measure was the co-occurrence of current nicotine dependence and Axis I and II disorders and severity of gambling based on the 10 inclusionary diagnostic criteria for pathological gambling. The study was conducted from 2001 to 2002. RESULTS: Among non-nicotine-dependent respondents, increasing gambling severity was associated with greater psychopathology for the majority of Axis I and II disorders. This pattern was not uniformly observed among nicotine-dependent subjects. Significant nicotine-by-gambling-group interactions were observed for multiple Axis I and II disorders. All significant interactions involved stronger associations between gambling and psychopathology in the non-nicotine-dependent group. CONCLUSIONS: In a large national sample, nicotine dependence influences the associations between gambling and multiple psychiatric disorders. Subsyndromal levels of gambling are associated with significant psychopathology. Nicotine dependence accounts for some of the elevated risks for psychopathology associated with subsyndromal and problem/pathological levels of gambling.

BACKGROUND: Psychotherapeutic approaches, mainly cognitive behavior therapy, and antidepressant medication are the two treatment modalities that have received most support in controlled outcome studies of bulimia nervosa. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to conduct a systematic review of all RCTs comparing antidepressants with psychological approaches or comparing their combination with each single approach for the treatment of bulimia nervosa. SEARCH STRATEGY: (1) electronic searches of MEDLINE (1966 to December 2000), EMBASE (1980-December 2000), PsycLIT (to December 2000), LILACS & SCISEARCH (to 1999) (2) the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register - ongoing (3) handsearches of the references of all identified trials (4) contact with the pharmaceutical companies and the principal investigator of each included trial (5) handsearch of the International Journal of Eating Disorders - ongoing INCLUSION CRITERIA: every randomized controlled trial in which antidepressants were compared with psychological treatments or the combination of antidepressants with psychological approaches was compared to each treatment alone, to reduce the symptoms of bulimia nervosa in patients of any age or gender. Quality criteria: reports were considered adequate if they were classified as A or B according to the Cochrane Manual. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted independently by two reviewers for each included trial. The main outcome for efficacy was full remission of bulimic symptoms, defined as 100% reduction in binge or purge episodes from baseline to endpoint. Dichotomous data was evaluated by the relative risks and 95% confidence intervals around this measure, based on the random effects model; continuous data was evaluated by the average difference and the 95% confidence interval. Number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH) were calculated using the inverse of the absolute risk reduction. MAIN RESULTS: Five trials were included in comparison one (antidepressants versus psychological treatments), five in comparison two (antidepressants versus the combination) and seven in comparison three (psychological treatments versus the combination). Remission rates were 20% for single antidepressants compared to 39% for single psychotherapy (DerSimonian-Laird Relative Risk = 1.28; 95% Confidence Interval = 0.98;1.67). Dropout rates were higher for antidepressants than for psychotherapy (DerSimonian-Laird Relative Risk = 2.18; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.09;4.35). The NNH for a mean treatment duration of 17.5 weeks was 4 (95% confidence interval = 3;11). Comparison two found remission rates of 42% for the combination versus 23% for antidepressants (DerSimonian-Laird Relative Risk = 1.38; 95% Confidence Interval = 0.98;1.93). Comparison three showed a 36% pooled remission rate for psychological approaches compared to 49% for the combination (DerSimonian-Laird Relative Risk = 1.21; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.02;1.45). The NNT for a mean treatment duration of 15 weeks was 8 (95% Confidence Interval = 4;320). Dropout rates were higher for the combination compared to single psychological treatments (DerSimonian-Laird Relative Risk = 0.57; 95% Confidence Interval = 0.38;0.88). The NNH was 7 (95% Confidence Interval = 4;21). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Using a more conservative statistical approach, combination treatments were superior to single psychotherapy. This was the only statistically significant difference between treatments. The number of trials might be insufficient to show the statistical significance of a 19% absolute risk reduction in efficacy favouring psychotherapy or combination treatments over single antidepressants. Psychotherapy appeared to be more acceptable to subjects. When antidepressants were combined to psychological treatments, acceptability of the latter was significantly reduced."

Recently incidence of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) has been increasing in Japan associated with an increase in alcoholic beverage consumption. There have been a large number of reports about the relationship between alcohol and hepatocarcinogenesis, but it remains controversial. In this review, we addressed 1) the recent trend in incidence of ALD including severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH), liver cirrhosis (LC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in heavy drinkers in Japan, and 2) the characteristics of HCC in heavy drinkers with negative serum markers for viral hepatitis. We carried out nation-wide survey by asking for the hospitals that are approved by the Japanese Society of Gastroenterology for recent aspects of in-patients with ALD. Except for HCC, percentage of ALD without viral hepatitis is more than 70%, which is increased when compared to the national survey carried out in 1992. Percentage of alcoholic LC without positive markers for viral hepatitis was 61% and alcohol plus virus group was 39%. Furthermore, in alcoholic LC patients without HCC, those who did not have viral hepatitis were 80%. However, the percentage of HCC without viral hepatitis was 27% of all of the heavy drinkers with HCC. Regarding our own cases, subjects were 432 HCC patients who were admitted to our hospital since 1995. There were 296 cases (68.5%) of HCV-positive, 70 cases (16.2%) of HBV-positive, 27 cases (6.3%) of both HCV- and HBV-positive. Thirty-nine cases (6.7%) were negative for serum markers for viral hepatitis. Among them, 13 cases (3.0%) were not heavy drinkers (non-B, non-C, non-alcohol) and 26 cases (6.0%) were heavy drinkers (non-B, non-C, heavy drinkers). Twenty-five of these 26 (96.2%) cases had cirrhosis. In conclusion, since the consumption of alcohol is increasing in Japan, the frequency and number of cases of alcoholic liver cirrhosis are increasing. Viral hepatitis infection, however, still plays an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis in heavy drinkers. Radiographic examinations at an appropriate interval for HCC are recommended, even in cases with alcoholic liver cirrhosis who are negative for serum markers of viral hepatitis, to ensure the early diagnosis of HCC."

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There have been no multicity studies on the acute effects of air pollution on stroke mortality in China. This study was undertaken to examine the associations between daily stroke mortality and outdoor air pollution (particulate matter <10 mum in aerodynamic diameter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide) in 8 Chinese cities. METHODS: We used Poisson regression models with natural spline-smoothing functions to adjust for long-term and seasonal trends, as well as other time-varying covariates. We applied 2-stage Bayesian hierarchical statistical models to estimate city-specific and national average associations of air pollution with daily stroke mortality. RESULTS: Air pollution was associated with daily stroke mortality in 8 Chinese cities. In the combined analysis, an increase of 10 mug/m(3) of 2-day moving average concentrations of particulate matter <10 mum in aerodynamic diameter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide corresponded to 0.54% (95% posterior intervals, 0.28-0.81), 0.88% (95% posterior intervals, 0.54-1.22), and 1.47% (95% posterior intervals, 0.88-2.06) increase of stroke mortality, respectively. The concentration-response curves indicated linear nonthreshold associations between air pollution and risk of stroke mortality. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first multicity study in China, or even in other developing countries, to report the acute effect of air pollution on stroke mortality. Our results contribute to very limited data on the effect of air pollution on stroke for high-exposure settings typical in developing countries."

In the combined analysis, an increase of 10 mug/m(3) of 2-day moving average concentrations of particulate matter <10 mum in aerodynamic diameter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide corresponded to 0.54% (95% posterior intervals, 0.28-0.81), 0.88% (95% posterior intervals, 0.54-1.22), and 1.47% (95% posterior intervals, 0.88-2.06) increase of stroke mortality, respectively. The concentration-response curves indicated linear nonthreshold associations between air pollution and risk of stroke mortality. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first multicity study in China, or even in other developing countries, to report the acute effect of air pollution on stroke mortality. Our results contribute to very limited data on the effect of air pollution on stroke for high-exposure settings typical in developing countries."

PURPOSE: This study examined the association between sleep duration trajectories from adolescence to young adulthood and the risk of asthma into young adulthood. METHODS: Using data from 10,362 participants in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) free of asthma at baseline, we constructed trajectories of sleep duration from adolescence (age 13-18 years) to young adulthood (age 24-32 years) and used them to examine the association between sleep duration patterns and the risk of new-onset asthma using a log-binomial regression model after adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: The results revealed that 14.4% of nonasthmatic participants had persistent short sleep duration, whereas 80.0% had adequate sleep duration from adolescence through young adulthood. Consistently short-sleepers had 1.52 times the risk of new-onset asthma by age 32 years (95% CI 1.11, 2.10) compared with consistently adequate sleepers. The association was stronger in those with a family history of asthma (aRR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.15, 5.13) than in those without such history (aRR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.05, 1.95). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that persistent short sleep duration is associated with an increased risk of new-onset asthma in young adults. This association may be more pronounced among those at high risk of asthma because of family history."

BACKGROUND: The scientific evidence on cardiovascular risks associated with long-term use of snuff is limited and inconclusive. The use of this smokeless tobacco has increased in recent decades, and adverse health effects associated with snuff use could be of great public health concern. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study whether long-term use of snuff affects the risk of myocardial infarction. DESIGN: Between 1978 and 1993 all construction workers in Sweden were offered repeated health check-ups by the Swedish Construction Industry's Organization for Working Environment Safety and Health. A cohort was created with information on tobacco use and other risk factors, collected through questionnaires. SETTING: In total, 118,395 nonsmoking men without a history of myocardial infarction were followed through 2004. Information on myocardial infarction morbidity and mortality was obtained from national registers. Relative risk estimates were derived from Cox proportional hazards regression model, with adjustment for age, body mass index and region of residence. RESULTS: Almost 30% of the men had used snuff. In total, 118 395 nonsmoking men without a history of myocardial infarction were followed through 2004. The multivariable-adjusted relative risks for ever snuff users were 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.02) for nonfatal cases and 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.55) for fatal cases. Heavy users (>or=50 g day(-1)) had a relative risk of fatal myocardial infarction of 1.96 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.58).

BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to assess the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on health behaviors, metabolic control, and chronic complications in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from South Korea, a country with universal health insurance coverage and that has experienced rapid economic and social transition. METHODS: A total of 3,294 Korean men and women with T2DM aged 30 to 65 years, participating in the Korean National Diabetes Program (KNDP) cohort who reported their SES and had baseline clinical evaluation were included in the current cross-sectional analysis. SES included the level of education and monthly household income. RESULTS: Lower education level and lower income level were closely related, and both were associated with older age in men and women. Women and men with lower income and education level had higher carbohydrate and lower fat intake. After adjustment for possible confounding factors, higher education in men significantly lowered the odds of having uncontrolled hyperglycemia (glycosylated hemoglobin >=7.5%) (odds ratio [OR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.91 for highest education; P(trend)=0.048), while higher household income in men significantly lowered the odds of having diabetic retinopathy (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.95 for highest income level; P(trend)=0.048).

Background exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs), lipophilic xenobiotics that accumulate mainly in adipose tissue, has recently emerged as a new risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. This prospective study was performed to evaluate if plasma concentrations of selected POPs predict incident stroke among the elderly. Twenty-one POPs (including 16 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, 3 organochlorine (OC) pesticides, 1 brominated diphenyl ether (BDE), and 1 dioxin) were measured in plasma collected at baseline in 898 participants aged 70 years of the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS). Stroke diagnosis was validated by hospital records. During the five year follow-up, 35 subjects developed hospital-treated stroke. After adjusting for known stroke risk factors, most PCBs with 4, 5, or 6 chlorine atoms, p,p'-DDE, trans-nonachlor, and octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin significantly predicted the risk of stroke. Across quartiles of summary measures of PCBs and OC pesticides, the adjusted ORs were 1.0, 0.8 (95% confidence interval: 0.2-2.5), 1.2 (0.4-3.4), and 2.1 (0.7-6.2) for PCBs and 1.0, 1.2 (0.3-4.2), 2.3 (0.7-6.9), and 3.0 (1.0-9.4) for OC pesticides (P for trend=0.11 and 0.03, respectively).

PURPOSE: The first aim of this study was to compare nighttime voiding frequency (nocturia), serum hemoglobin A1c level, peripheral neuropathy score, and global sleep quality score in younger (>40 to <65 years) versus older (>=65 years) women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Additional aims were to identify factors associated with clinically relevant nocturia (>=2 episodes/night) and to analyze relationships between nocturia frequency, glycemic control, peripheral neuropathy, and sleep quality in these women. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Participants were 118 women older than 40 years and with type 2 DM. Their mean age was 65.25 (SD = 9.66) years; the mean duration since diagnosis of type 2 DM was 10.96 (SD = 7.66) years. The study setting was 2 metabolism and endocrinology outpatient departments located in Taipei City and Taoyuan, Taiwan. METHODS: Data were collected using a questionnaire that queried sociodemographic information, lower urinary tract symptoms, and sleep quality. We also assessed peripheral neuropathy and lower extremity edema and obtained pertinent information from participants' medical records. Independent t tests, multivariate logistic regression analyses, Spearman's rank correlation coefficients, and one-way analysis of variance were used to address the 3 study aims. RESULTS: Analyses found that older women (aged >=65 years) had a significantly higher nighttime voiding frequency, a higher peripheral neuropathy score, and a higher sleep quality score than younger (>40 to <65 years) women. Multivariate logistic regression analyses identified 4 factors associated with clinically relevant nocturia advanced age, elevated hemoglobin A1c level, suspected peripheral neuropathy, and lower extremity edema. Significant correlation coefficients were found between nighttime voiding frequency and serum hemoglobin A1c levels, peripheral neuropathy scores, and sleep quality scores. Analyses also found that women with a greater nocturia frequency had higher hemoglobin A1c levels, peripheral neuropathy scores, and sleep quality scores. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals should screen for nocturia in women with type 2 DM and provide appropriate management for those experiencing nocturia."

OBJECTIVE: Previous research has revealed poor oral hygiene and health among older people suffering from dementia. To evaluate the oral health and denture hygiene of older people with and without dementia, six months after carer have followed a dental education programme. METHOD: Ninety-three older people living in four long-term care homes in south-western Germany were included in this longitudinal cohort study. All participants were allocated into two groups on basis of the medical dementia diagnosis extracted from the medical records in the care documentation: suffering from dementia (n = 33) or not (n = 60). For each participant plaque control record, gingival bleeding index (GBI), community periodontal index of treatment needs (CPITN), and denture hygiene index (DHI) were assessed at baseline and six months after carer have followed a dental education programme, and after use of ultrasonic devices for denture cleaning. Differences between all target variables from baseline to follow-up, and between participants with and without dementia, were evaluated by bivariate and multivariate testing. RESULTS: In bivariate testing, participants with dementia had a significantly lower DHI (p < 0.001), a lower GBI (p < 0.05), and a lower CPITN (p < 0.01) at follow-up. In participants without dementia, only for DHI (p < 0.001) a significant improvement was observed. In multivariate analyses, the significant association could not be reproduced (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Use of ultrasonic baths can be a successful means for improving denture hygiene among older people in long-term care with and without dementia. Education for carer in order to improve oral hygiene, however, seems to be of minor significance and to be more effective for people with dementia."

The design was a cross-sectional study with descriptive and analytical components. The subjects were six to twelve year old schoolboys from all male travelling children in Cork and from a selection of settled schoolboys. In addition the study collected information on the predictor variables--age, passive smoking and number of siblings. The questionnaire was administered to 54 travelling boys and 129 controls. The parent reported prevalence of wheeze and related symptoms were all more common in controls compared with the travelling boys. The values were significant for wheeze in the last year (31.3% v 14.8%; OR-5.6, p = 0.025), and for doctor diagnosed asthma (25.6% v 11.1%; OR = 5.1, p = 0.04). Schoolboys from travelling families have less wheeze and doctor diagnosed asthma than controls. The experience of the travelling lifestyle maybe a protective factor in the development of asthma."

urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma	juice of pomegranate fruit	Treats	26955879	train	T6	T14	452:488	537:563	"Clarification of the molecular pathway of Taiwan local pomegranate fruit juice underlying the inhibition of urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma cell by proteomics strategy. 
BACKGROUND: Pomegranate fruit has been shown to exhibit the inhibitory activity against prostate cancer and lung cancer in vitro and in vivo, which might be a resource for chemoprevention and chemotherapy of cancer. Our previous documented findings indicated that treatment of urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma cell with the ethanol extract isolated from the juice of pomegranate fruit grown in Taiwan could inhibit tumor cell. In this study we intended to uncover the molecular pathway underlying anti-cancer efficacy of Taiwan pomegranate fruit juice against urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma. METHODS: We exploited two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to find the de-regulated proteins. Western immunoblotting was used to confirm the results collected from proteomics study. RESULTS: Comparative proteomics indicated that 20 proteins were differentially expressed in ethanol extract-treated T24 cells with 19 up-regulated and 1 down-regulated proteins. These de-regulated proteins were involved in apoptosis, cytoskeleton regulation, cell proliferation, proteasome activity and aerobic glycolysis. Further studies on signaling pathway demonstrated that ethanol extract treatment might inhibit urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma cell proliferation through restriction of PTEN/AKT/mTORC1 pathway via profilin 1 up-regulation. It also might evoke cell apoptosis through Diablo over-expression. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide a global picture to further investigate the anticancer molecular mechanism of pomegranate fruit."

Dietary potassium supplementation lowers blood pressure (BP) and attenuates complications in hypertensive subjects, particularly those with the low renin volume expanded (LRVE) variety. We and others have shown that the plasma level of a digitalis like substance (DLS) is elevated in this type of hypertension. We therefore, examined the effect of increases in dietary potassium on the plasma level of endogenous DLS, myocardial and renal Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA) activities, BP, and renal excretory function in reduced renal mass (RRM)-salt hypertension in the rat, a classical model of LRVE hypertension. 70% RRM rats were divided in 4 groups, namely those consuming: 1) a sodium free and normal potassium (1.3% as KCl) diet (RRM-0 Na), 2) a normal sodium and normal potassium diet (RRM-NaK), 3) a normal sodium and high potassium (2 X normal) diet (RRM-Na2K), and 4) a normal sodium and 4 times normal potassium diet (RRM-Na4K). At the end of 4 weeks of dietary treatment, direct BP was recorded, plasma level of DLS determined by bioassay and with a radioimmunoassay for digoxin (DIF) and myocardial and renal NKA activities were measured. As expected, compared to RRM-0Na rats, RRM-NaK rats developed hypertension. BP increased significantly less in RRM-Na2K, whereas BP did not increase in RRM-Na4K rats. Hypertension in RRM-NaK rats was associated with an increase in plasma DLS and DIF and decrease in renal and myocardial NKA activities. DLS was increased (DIF was not changed) and myocardial NKA also decreased in rats consuming double potassium. However, quadrupling potassium in the diet (RRM-Na4K) normalized DLS and DIF and increased myocardial and renal NKA activities, compared to RRM-0Na rats. Also compared to RRM-0Na, water consumption, urinary volume excretion, sodium, and potassium increased in the other 3 groups, more so in RRM-Na4K rats. These data show that quadrupling the potassium in the diet prevents the BP increase in RRM rats and this is associated with diuresis/natriuresis and normalization of DLS, perhaps because the diuresis/natriuresis normalizes blood volume."

In Crohn's disease, severe skeletal demineralization, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and muscle weakness can occur. This may be caused by impaired vitamin D absorption, resulting from extensive intestinal disease and resection of duodenum and jejunum, where vitamin D is absorbed. We report a 57-year-old woman with a long history of Crohn's disease and short-bowel syndrome who had only 2 feet of small intestine remaining after 3 bowel resections. She was taking a daily multivitamin containing 400 IU of vitamin D(3) and was dependent on total parenteral nutrition that contained 200 IU of vitamin D and calcium (18 mEq in a 1-L bag infused over 8 hours daily) for a period of 36 months. Despite the above replacement, she complained of bone pain and muscle weakness, and she continued to be vitamin D-deficient with a 25(OH)D level <20 ng/mL. She was then exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation in a tanning bed wearing a 1-piece bathing suit for 10 minutes, 3 times a week for 6 months at the General Clinical Research Center, Boston University Medical Center. She tolerated the irradiation well without evidence of erythema. After 4 weeks, her serum 25(OH)D level increased by 357% from 7 to 32 ng/mL, parathyroid hormone level decreased by 52% from 92 to 44 pg/mL, and the serum calcium level increased from 7.8 to 8.5 mg/dL. After 6 months of UVB treatment, her serum 25(OH)D level was maintained in the normal range and was free of muscle weakness, and bone and muscle pain."
Alexithymia	gambling	positive_statistical_association	28211964	dev	T10	T11	686:697	743:751	"Relationship between pathological gambling, alexithymia, and gambling type. 
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to see if: (i) alexithymia is associated with PG and with the severity of gambling behavior; (ii) alexithymia is associated with strategic and non-strategic gambling. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-six gamblers were recruited in different gambling locations. First, pathological gamblers (PGs) (n = 106) were compared to non-pathological gamblers (NPGs) (n = 120). Second, strategic gamblers (n = 92) were compared to non-strategic gamblers (n = 96). RESULTS: After controlling for being or not depressed, PGs have significantly higher alexithymia scores. Alexithymia is positively correlated to the intensity of gambling behavior and associated with PG: being alexithymic (OR = 4.21, SEB = .32, p < .001), ""difficulty identifying feelings"" (OR = 1.07, SEB = .03, p = .038), and ""externally-oriented thinking"" (OR = 1.07, SEB = .03, p = .026) factors. Nevertheless, while alexithymia is associated with PG in strategic gamblers (being alexithymic (OR = 6.80, SEB = .50 p < .001) and ""difficulty identifying feelings"" (OR = 1.12, SEB = .05 p = .026) factor), this is not the case in non-strategic gamblers. In the latter, only depression is associated with PG (OR = 3.43, SEB = .50 p = .013). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The results highlight the importance of taking into account the gambling type in the relationship between alexithymia, depression, and PG. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: In non-strategic PGs, specific therapies targeting depression could be appropriate, while for strategic PGs, specific psychotherapeutic techniques like body-centered psychotherapy could help them to differentiate feelings from bodily sensations.

CONTEXT: Despite previous studies regarding the association between smoking and diabetes, the effects of electronic cigarettes and second-hand smoke (SHS) on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity have not been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of mixed electronic and conventional cigarette use and exposure to SHS with prediabetes. DESIGN: Data from the 2014-2018 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed. SETTING: Nationwide population-based. PARTICIPANTS: Of 39,199 participants, 22,385 participants (9,490 men, 12,895 women) without diabetes were included. The main independent variables were smoking behaviors, including exposure to SHS. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Prediabetes (HbA1C of 5.7-6.4%). RESULTS: Of 22,385 participants without diabetes, 6,735 had prediabetes. Mixed cigarette use was associated with a 1.57-fold increase in the odds of prediabetes when compared with never-smoking (odds ratio [OR]=1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.29-1.92) and a 1.27-fold increase when compared with conventional cigarette use only (OR=1.27, 95% CI=1.07-1.52). Participants who were current non-smokers but mixed users in the past had an increased risk of prediabetes (OR=1.54, 95% CI=1.04-2.13). There was no significant association between prediabetes and current non-smoking in individuals with previous conventional cigarette use only. Among never-smokers, exposure to SHS significantly increased the risk of prediabetes (OR=1.16, 95% CI=1.04-1.30). CONCLUSIONS: Mixed use of electronic and conventional cigarettes and exposure to SHS increased the risk of prediabetes.

BACKGROUND: Many schools transitioned online to reduce viral spread and promote social distancing amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Remote learning may impact health behaviors and coping strategies among adolescents, including reduced physical activity and increased screen time. Social media and peers provide information about the pandemic to adolescents and may influence prevention behaviors. This study aims to assess adolescent knowledge and information about COVID-19, determine students' behavior change, and identify sources students turn to for information on the pandemic. METHODS: Students from 2 high schools in semi-rural Georgia participated in a cross-sectional online survey in March 2020 (N = 761). RESULTS: Common sources for COVID-19 news were peers (80%) and social media (58%). Few adolescents (3%) indicated that teenagers were at higher risk of severe illness due to COVID-19. Responses reveal adolescents understand social distancing and many are participating in prevention behaviors, including handwashing (87%) and staying at home as much as possible (87%). Most respondents reported increases in screen time outside of class (82%). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest adolescents are obtaining COVID-19 knowledge from various sources, including social media, with varying degrees of implementation of prevention practices. Increases in screen time and reduced physical activity may impact long-term health among adolescents."
meningitis	curcumin	Treats	17381860	dev	T7	T6	448:458	385:393	"Efficacy of curcumin therapy against Angiostrongylus cantonensis-induced eosinophilic meningitis. 
Angiostrongylus cantonensis can invade the central nervous system, leading to human eosinophilic meningitis or eosinophilic meningoencephalitis. Curcumin is a natural product which has the effects of anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and anti-carcinogensis, while the administration of curcumin has been reported to possibly relieve the symptoms of meningitis. The present study tested the potential efficacy of curcumin in A. cantonensis-induced eosinophilic meningitis of BALB/c mice. Assay indicators for the therapeutic effect included the larvicidal effect, eosinophil counts and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity in angiostrongyliasis. Eosinophils were mildly reduced in treatment groups compared with infected-untreated mice. However, there were no significant differences in larvicidal effects or MMP-9 activity. This study suggests that anti-inflammatory treatment with curcumin alone has low efficacy, but the treatment does not interfere with MMP-9 expression and is not useful for larvicidal effects. The possible reasons include low curcumin across the blood-brain barrier and also those larvae that survive stimulate MMP-9 production, which promotes blood-brain barrier damage, with leukocytes then crossing the blood-brain barrier to cause meningitis. Further studies will be required to test these possibilities."

depression	appropriate diet	Treats	23306210	dev	T22	T4	449:459	409:425	"Effect of diet on serotonergic neurotransmission in depression. 
Depression is characterized by sadness, purposelessness, irritability, and impaired body functions. Depression causes severe symptoms for several weeks, and dysthymia, which may cause chronic, low-grade symptoms. Treatment of depression involves psychotherapy, medications, or phototherapy. Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that an appropriate diet can reduce symptoms of depression. The neurotransmitter, serotonin (5-HT), synthesized in the brain, plays an important role in mood alleviation, satiety, and sleep regulation. Although certain fruits and vegetables are rich in 5-HT, it is not easily accessible to the CNS due to blood brain barrier. However the serotonin precursor, tryptophan, can readily pass through the blood brain barrier. Tryptophan is converted to 5-HT by tryptophan hydroxylase and 5-HTP decarboxylase, respectively, in the presence of pyridoxal phosphate, derived from vitamin B(6). Hence diets poor in tryptophan may induce depression as this essential amino acid is not naturally abundant even in protein-rich foods. Tryptophan-rich diet is important in patients susceptible to depression such as certain females during pre and postmenstrual phase, post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic pain, cancer, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. Carbohydrate-rich diet triggers insulin response to enhance the bioavailability of tryptophan in the CNS which is responsible for increased craving of carbohydrate diets. Although serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are prescribed to obese patients with depressive symptoms, these agents are incapable of precisely regulating the CNS serotonin and may cause life-threatening adverse effects in the presence of monoamine oxidase inhibitors. However, CNS serotonin synthesis can be controlled by proper intake of tryptophan-rich diet. This report highlights the clinical significance of tryptophan-rich diet and vitamin B(6) to boost serotonergic neurotransmission in depression observed in various neurodegenerative diseases. However pharmacological interventions to modulate serotonergic neurotransmission in depression, remains clinically significant. Depression may involve several other molecular mechanisms as discussed briefly in this report."

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relation between occupational dust exposure and lung cancer in tin mines. This is an update of a previous study of miners with high exposure to dust at four tin mines in southern China. METHODS: A nested case-control study of 130 male lung cancer cases and 627 controls was initiated from a cohort study of 7855 subjects employed at least 1 year between 1972 and 1974 in four tin mines in China. Three of the tin mines were in Dachang and one was in Limu. Cumulative total exposure to dust and cumulative exposure to arsenic were calculated for each person based on industrial hygiene records. Measurements of arsenic, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and radon in the work sites were also evaluated. Odds ratios (ORs), standard statistic analysis and logistic regression were used for analyses. RESULTS: Increased risk of lung cancer was related to cumulative exposure to dust, duration of exposure, cumulative exposure to arsenic, and tobacco smoking. The risk ratios for low, medium, and high cumulative exposure to dust were 2.1 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.1 to 3.8), 1.7 (95% CI 0.9 to 3.1), and 2.8 (95% CI 1.6 to 5.0) respectively after adjustment for smoking. The risk for lung cancer among workers with short, medium, and long exposure to dust were 1.9 (95% CI 1.0 to 3.5), 2.3 (95% CI 1.3 to 4.1), and 2.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 4.2) respectively after adjusting for smoking. Several sets of risk factors for lung cancer were compared, and the best predictive model included tobacco smoking (OR=1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.4) and cumulative exposure to arsenic (ORs for different groups from low to high exposure were 2.1 (95% CI 1.1 to 3.9); 2.1 (95% CI 1.1 to 3.9); 1.8 (95% CI 1.0 to 3.6); and 3.6 (95% CI 1.8 5 to 7.3)). No excess of lung cancer was found among silicotic subjects in the Limu tin mine although there was a high prevalence of silicosis. Exposures to radon were low in the four tin mines and no carcinogenic PAHs were detected. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide little support for the hypothesis that respirable crystalline silica induces lung cancer. Ore dust in work sites acts as a carrier, the exposure to arsenic and tobacco smoking play a more important part in carcinogenesis of lung cancer in tin miners. Silicosis seems not to be related to the increased risk of lung cancer."

Three of the tin mines were in Dachang and one was in Limu. Cumulative total exposure to dust and cumulative exposure to arsenic were calculated for each person based on industrial hygiene records. Measurements of arsenic, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and radon in the work sites were also evaluated. Odds ratios (ORs), standard statistic analysis and logistic regression were used for analyses. RESULTS: Increased risk of lung cancer was related to cumulative exposure to dust, duration of exposure, cumulative exposure to arsenic, and tobacco smoking. The risk ratios for low, medium, and high cumulative exposure to dust were 2.1 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.1 to 3.8), 1.7 (95% CI 0.9 to 3.1), and 2.8 (95% CI 1.6 to 5.0) respectively after adjustment for smoking. The risk for lung cancer among workers with short, medium, and long exposure to dust were 1.9 (95% CI 1.0 to 3.5), 2.3 (95% CI 1.3 to 4.1), and 2.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 4.2) respectively after adjusting for smoking. Several sets of risk factors for lung cancer were compared, and the best predictive model included tobacco smoking (OR=1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.4) and cumulative exposure to arsenic (ORs for different groups from low to high exposure were 2.1 (95% CI 1.1 to 3.9); 2.1 (95% CI 1.1 to 3.9); 1.8 (95% CI 1.0 to 3.6); and 3.6 (95% CI 1.8 5 to 7.3)). No excess of lung cancer was found among silicotic subjects in the Limu tin mine although there was a high prevalence of silicosis. Exposures to radon were low in the four tin mines and no carcinogenic PAHs were detected. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide little support for the hypothesis that respirable crystalline silica induces lung cancer. Ore dust in work sites acts as a carrier, the exposure to arsenic and tobacco smoking play a more important part in carcinogenesis of lung cancer in tin miners. Silicosis seems not to be related to the increased risk of lung cancer."

BACKGROUND: The relationship between diet and cardiovascular risk factors in men and women with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) has been the subject of recent studies. We studied a group of Iranian CAD patients to analyze any relationship between diet and CAD risk factors based on gender. METHODS: In this study, 461 consecutive patients were assessed before their planned isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery. They were interviewed to obtain the quantity and components of nutrients and micronutrients based on a validated food frequency questionnaire. Diet scores were calculated in each dietary group and the total score was reported as the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index (Med-DQI). Physical activity was assessed using International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Functional class, EuroSCORE and the frequency of the known risk factors in the men and women were recorded as well. RESULTS: The women were more likely than the men to present with obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension (all Ps < 0.001). Also, the women had higher functional class and mean of EuroSCORE (P < 0.001 and P = 0.03). Only six women (5.7%) reported to have regular physical activity. In addition, Women's energy intake was more likely to be supplied through fat. Cereals, fruit, and vegetable consumption in both genders was within the safe recommended range, while olive and fish consumption was low in both sexes. MedDQI score was different between men and women with hypertension (P = 0.018) and obesity (P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Modifiable classical risk factors for CAD, except for smoking, were more prevalent in women and were associated with their diet. Therefore, women probably need to maintain low calorie intake while improving physical activity and dietary patterns to decrease the frequency and severity of modifiable cardiac risk factors."

We conducted a systematic review of the literature exploring polysomnographic differences between PD patients and controls in EMBASE, MEDLINE, All EBM databases, CINAHL, and PsycIFNO. 67 studies were identified for systematic review, 63 of which were used for meta-analysis. Meta-analyses revealed significant reductions in total sleep time, sleep efficiency, N2 percentage, slow wave sleep, rapid eye movement sleep (REM) percentage, and increases in wake time after sleep onset, N1 percentage, REM latency, apnea hypopnea index, and periodic limb movement index in PD patients compared with controls. There were no remarkable differences in sleep continuity or sleep architecture between PD patients with and without REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Our study suggests that PD patients have poor sleep quality and quantity. Sex, age, disease duration, presence of RBD, medication status, cognitive impairment, and adaptation night are factors that contributed to heterogeneity between studies."
Diarrhoea	travellers	positive_statistical_association	30444557	dev	T2	T33	172:181	253:263	"Locals get travellers' diarrhoea too: risk factors for diarrhoeal illness and pathogenic Escherichia coli infection across an urban-rural gradient in Ecuador. 
OBJECTIVES: Diarrhoea is a common and well-studied cause of illness afflicting international travellers. However, traveller's diarrhoea can also result from travel between high and low disease transmission regions within a country, which is the focus of this study. METHODS: We recruited participants for a case-control study of diarrhoea at four sites along an urban-rural gradient in Northern Ecuador: Quito, Esmeraldas, Borbon and rural communities outside of Borbon. At each of these sites, approximately 100 subjects with diarrhoea (cases) were recruited from Ministry of Health clinics and were age-matched with subjects visiting the same clinics for other complaints (controls). RESULTS: Travellers to urban destinations had higher risk of diarrhoea and diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) infections. Travel to Quito was associated with diarrhoea (aOR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.10-3.68) and travel to Guayaquil (another urban centre in Ecuador) was associated with Diffuse Adherent E. coli infection (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.01-4.33). Compared to those not travelling, urban origins were also associated with greater risk of diarrhoea in Esmeraldas (aOR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.20-4.41), and with higher risk of diarrhoeagenic E. coli infections in Quito (aOR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.16-5.86), with >50% of travel from Quito and Esmeraldas specified to another urban destination. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that individuals travelling from lower-transmission regions (rural areas) to higher transmission regions (urban centres) within a single country are at a greater risk of acquiring a diarrhoea-related illness. Investments to improve water, sanitation and hygiene conditions in urban areas could have impacts on outlying rural areas within a given country."
PPROM	Vitamin C supplementations	Prevents	23682322	dev	T16	T15	1467:1472	1393:1419	"The role of vitamin C in prevention of preterm premature rupture of membranes. 
BACKGROUND: Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is one of the most important complications of the pregnancy and cause perinatal morbidity and mortality. History of PPROM is a risk factor of recurrent PPROM. Vitamin C plays an important role in collagen metabolism and increases resistance maintenance of the chorioamniotic membranes. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of vitamin C supplementation in prevention of PPROM in women with a positive history of PPROM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This clinical trial study was performed on 170 pregnant women with the history of PPROM, with singleton pregnancy and gestational age 14 weeks in Imam-Reza Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences during 2008 to 2010. They were randomly divided into two groups. The case patients received 100 mg vitamin C daily from 14th weeks of gestation. PPROM occurrence was compared between two groups as an indicator of the protective effect of vitamin C supplements. RESULTS: PPROM occurred in 44.7% of controls and 31.8% of cases (P &lt; 0.05). PROM occurred in 34.1% of controls and 18.8% of cases (P &lt; 0.05). Pregnancy was terminated at term gestation in 21.2% of controls and 49.4% of cases (P &lt; 0.05). Rupture of membranes was significantly decreased in the case group. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin C supplementations after 14th weeks of gestation can prevent from PPROM in women with the history of PPROM."

Exposure to benzene, an important industrial chemical and component of gasoline, is a widely recognized cause of leukemia, but its association with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is less clear. To clarify this issue, we undertook a systematic review of all case-control and cohort studies that identified probable occupational exposures to benzene and NHL morbidity or mortality. We identified 43 case-control studies of NHL outcomes that recognized persons with probable occupational exposure to benzene. Forty of these 43 (93%) studies show some elevation of NHL risk, with 23 of 43 (53%) studies finding statistically significant associations between NHL risk and probable benzene exposure. We also identified 26 studies of petroleum refinery workers reporting morbidity or mortality for lymphomas and all neoplasms and found that in 23 (88%), the rate of lymphoma morbidity or mortality was higher than that for all neoplasms. A substantial healthy-worker effect was evident in many of the studies and a comprehensive reevaluation of these studies with appropriate adjustments should be undertaken. Numerous studies have also reported associations between benzene exposure and the induction of lymphomas in mice. Further, because benzene is similar to alkylating drugs and radiation in producing leukemia, it is plausible that it might also produce lymphoma as they do and by similar mechanisms. Potential mechanisms include immunotoxicity and the induction of double-strand breaks with subsequent chromosome damage resulting in translocations and deletions. We conclude that, overall, the evidence supports an association between occupational benzene exposure and NHL."

BACKGROUND: The non-communicable diseases dental caries and periodontal diseases pose an enormous burden on mankind. The dental biofilm is a major biological determinant common to the development of both diseases, and they share common risk factors and social determinants, important for their prevention and control. The remit of this working group was to review the current state of knowledge on epidemiology, socio-behavioural aspects as well as plaque control with regard to dental caries and periodontal diseases. METHODS: Discussions were informed by three systematic reviews on (i) the global burden of dental caries and periodontitis; (ii) socio-behavioural aspects in the prevention and control of dental caries and periodontal diseases at an individual and population level; and (iii) mechanical and chemical plaque control in the simultaneous management of gingivitis and dental caries. This consensus report is based on the outcomes of these systematic reviews and on expert opinion of the participants. RESULTS: Key findings included the following: (i) prevalence and experience of dental caries has decreased in many regions in all age groups over the last three decades; however, not all societal groups have benefitted equally from this decline; (ii) although some studies have indicated a possible decline in periodontitis prevalence, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that prevalence has changed over recent decades; (iii) because of global population growth and increased tooth retention, the number of people affected by dental caries and periodontitis has grown substantially, increasing the total burden of these diseases globally (by 37% for untreated caries and by 67% for severe periodontitis) as estimated between 1990 and 2013, with high global economic impact; (iv) there is robust evidence for an association of low socio-economic status with a higher risk of having dental caries/caries experience and also with higher prevalence of periodontitis; (v) the most important behavioural factor, affecting both dental caries and periodontal diseases, is routinely performed oral hygiene with fluoride; (vi) population-based interventions address behavioural factors to control dental caries and periodontitis through legislation (antismoking, reduced sugar content in foods and drinks), restrictions (taxes on sugar and tobacco) guidelines and campaigns; however, their efficacy remains to be evaluated; (vii) psychological approaches aimed at changing behaviour may improve the effectiveness of oral health education; (viii) different preventive strategies have proven to be effective during the course of life; (ix) management of both dental caries and gingivitis relies heavily on efficient self-performed oral hygiene, that is toothbrushing with a fluoride-containing toothpaste and interdental cleaning; (x) professional tooth cleaning, oral hygiene instruction and motivation, dietary advice and fluoride application are effective in managing dental caries and gingivitis.

RESULTS: Key findings included the following: (i) prevalence and experience of dental caries has decreased in many regions in all age groups over the last three decades; however, not all societal groups have benefitted equally from this decline; (ii) although some studies have indicated a possible decline in periodontitis prevalence, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that prevalence has changed over recent decades; (iii) because of global population growth and increased tooth retention, the number of people affected by dental caries and periodontitis has grown substantially, increasing the total burden of these diseases globally (by 37% for untreated caries and by 67% for severe periodontitis) as estimated between 1990 and 2013, with high global economic impact; (iv) there is robust evidence for an association of low socio-economic status with a higher risk of having dental caries/caries experience and also with higher prevalence of periodontitis; (v) the most important behavioural factor, affecting both dental caries and periodontal diseases, is routinely performed oral hygiene with fluoride; (vi) population-based interventions address behavioural factors to control dental caries and periodontitis through legislation (antismoking, reduced sugar content in foods and drinks), restrictions (taxes on sugar and tobacco) guidelines and campaigns; however, their efficacy remains to be evaluated; (vii) psychological approaches aimed at changing behaviour may improve the effectiveness of oral health education; (viii) different preventive strategies have proven to be effective during the course of life; (ix) management of both dental caries and gingivitis relies heavily on efficient self-performed oral hygiene, that is toothbrushing with a fluoride-containing toothpaste and interdental cleaning; (x) professional tooth cleaning, oral hygiene instruction and motivation, dietary advice and fluoride application are effective in managing dental caries and gingivitis.

BACKGROUND: The non-communicable diseases dental caries and periodontal diseases pose an enormous burden on mankind. The dental biofilm is a major biological determinant common to the development of both diseases, and they share common risk factors and social determinants, important for their prevention and control. The remit of this working group was to review the current state of knowledge on epidemiology, socio-behavioural aspects as well as plaque control with regard to dental caries and periodontal diseases. METHODS: Discussions were informed by three systematic reviews on (i) the global burden of dental caries and periodontitis; (ii) socio-behavioural aspects in the prevention and control of dental caries and periodontal diseases at an individual and population level; and (iii) mechanical and chemical plaque control in the simultaneous management of gingivitis and dental caries. This consensus report is based on the outcomes of these systematic reviews and on expert opinion of the participants. RESULTS: Key findings included the following: (i) prevalence and experience of dental caries has decreased in many regions in all age groups over the last three decades; however, not all societal groups have benefitted equally from this decline; (ii) although some studies have indicated a possible decline in periodontitis prevalence, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that prevalence has changed over recent decades; (iii) because of global population growth and increased tooth retention, the number of people affected by dental caries and periodontitis has grown substantially, increasing the total burden of these diseases globally (by 37% for untreated caries and by 67% for severe periodontitis) as estimated between 1990 and 2013, with high global economic impact; (iv) there is robust evidence for an association of low socio-economic status with a higher risk of having dental caries/caries experience and also with higher prevalence of periodontitis; (v) the most important behavioural factor, affecting both dental caries and periodontal diseases, is routinely performed oral hygiene with fluoride; (vi) population-based interventions address behavioural factors to control dental caries and periodontitis through legislation (antismoking, reduced sugar content in foods and drinks), restrictions (taxes on sugar and tobacco) guidelines and campaigns; however, their efficacy remains to be evaluated; (vii) psychological approaches aimed at changing behaviour may improve the effectiveness of oral health education; (viii) different preventive strategies have proven to be effective during the course of life; (ix) management of both dental caries and gingivitis relies heavily on efficient self-performed oral hygiene, that is toothbrushing with a fluoride-containing toothpaste and interdental cleaning; (x) professional tooth cleaning, oral hygiene instruction and motivation, dietary advice and fluoride application are effective in managing dental caries and gingivitis. CONCLUSION: The prevention and control of dental caries and periodontal diseases and the prevention of ultimate tooth loss is a lifelong commitment employing population- and individual-based interventions."

Background: Amongst established growing industries worldwide, the construction industry contributes about 7.5% of the world labor force and 16.4% of global occupational diseases and accidents. A variety of activities are practiced in construction work, such as masonry, painting, welding, carpentry, plastering, concrete and cement mixing. These may eventually lead to exposures that can subject the workers to risks of developing occupational skin diseases. Most studies done on the construction industry in Tanzania have focused on effects such as injuries, respiratory problems and ergonomics; very little research has been done on skin diseases. Objectives: The study aimed at assessing the prevalence of occupational skin diseases, associated factors and preventive measures among building construction workers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Methods: Construction sites and participants were selected using simple random sampling. The Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire (NOSQ) was adapted and used for assessing the development of skin diseases among constructions workers. Analysis of categorical variables, associated factors and skin preventive measures was done using Chi-square tests. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio for factors indicating an influence on the occurrence of skin diseases. Findings: The study consisted of 420 building construction workers from different sites with a mean age of 32.7 years. The participants were masons, assistant masons and carpenters. The mean work duration was 6 years. Occupational Skin diseases were prevalent in 228 (54%) workers. Carpenters had a higher prevalence of skin diseases 12(67%), followed by assistant masons 43 (64%). Timely provision of safety trainings and of PPE utility, training and guidance lowered the occurrence of skin diseases. Conclusion: A high number of construction workers experienced skin diseases, especially those who have worked for more than 4 years. Workers who received safety training before the work shift had lesser prevalence of skin diseases compared to those who did not. Receiving proper information on PPE usage and proper wearing of gloves had a protective effect."

BACKGROUND: Traffic-related air pollution has been associated with adverse cardiorespiratory effects, including increased asthma prevalence. However, there has been little study of effects of traffic exposure at school on new-onset asthma. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the relationship of new-onset asthma with traffic-related pollution near homes and schools. METHODS: Parent-reported physician diagnosis of new-onset asthma (n = 120) was identified during 3 years of follow-up of a cohort of 2,497 kindergarten and first-grade children who were asthma- and wheezing-free at study entry into the Southern California Children's Health Study. We assessed traffic-related pollution exposure based on a line source dispersion model of traffic volume, distance from home and school, and local meteorology. Regional ambient ozone, nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), and particulate matter were measured continuously at one central site monitor in each of 13 study communities. Hazard ratios (HRs) for new-onset asthma were scaled to the range of ambient central site pollutants and to the residential interquartile range for each traffic exposure metric. RESULTS: Asthma risk increased with modeled traffic-related pollution exposure from roadways near homes [HR 1.51; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.25-1.82] and near schools (HR 1.45; 95% CI, 1.06-1.98). Ambient NO(2) measured at a central site in each community was also associated with increased risk (HR 2.18; 95% CI, 1.18-4.01). In models with both NO(2) and modeled traffic exposures, there were independent associations of asthma with traffic-related pollution at school and home, whereas the estimate for NO(2) was attenuated (HR 1.37; 95% CI, 0.69-2.71).

cancer	consumption of alcohol	Causes	9801469	dev	T17	T11	1545:1551	1481:1503	"[Causes of cancer in Scandinavia and possible preventive measures]. 
The purpose of this work is to address future possibilities for avoiding cancer. We elucidate the most important known causes of cancer in the Nordic countries during the second half of this century and provide estimates of the numbers of cancer cases that might be avoided by the year 2000 if those causes were effectively eliminated. Information on the pattern of carcinogenic exposures in each of the five Nordic countries and the associated relative risk estimates from the scientific literature were obtained. The numbers of avoidable cancers were assessed on the basis of this information together with the associated population attributable risk percent, PAR%, i.e. the proportion of a given cancer that can be avoided upon elimination of the causative factor. The main causes of cancer include smoking, alcohol consumption, exposure to occupational carcinogens, radiation, obesity and infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and Helicobacter pylori. Annually, more than 18,000 cancers in men and 11,000 in women in the Nordic populations could be avoided by eliminating exposure to known carcinogens which is equivalent to 33 percent and 20 percent of all cancers arising in men and women, respectively, around the year 2000. Smoking habits account for a little more than half of these avoidable cases. Exposure to solar radiation, HPV and Helicobacter pylori, diagnostic and therapeutic radiation and consumption of alcohol play important roles in the causation of cancer, as each of these factors is linked with 1-5 percent of all cancers in men and women. Occupational exposures are also substantial causes in men (3 percent), and obesity is important in women (1 percent).

The purpose of this work is to address future possibilities for avoiding cancer. We elucidate the most important known causes of cancer in the Nordic countries during the second half of this century and provide estimates of the numbers of cancer cases that might be avoided by the year 2000 if those causes were effectively eliminated. Information on the pattern of carcinogenic exposures in each of the five Nordic countries and the associated relative risk estimates from the scientific literature were obtained. The numbers of avoidable cancers were assessed on the basis of this information together with the associated population attributable risk percent, PAR%, i.e. the proportion of a given cancer that can be avoided upon elimination of the causative factor. The main causes of cancer include smoking, alcohol consumption, exposure to occupational carcinogens, radiation, obesity and infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and Helicobacter pylori. Annually, more than 18,000 cancers in men and 11,000 in women in the Nordic populations could be avoided by eliminating exposure to known carcinogens which is equivalent to 33 percent and 20 percent of all cancers arising in men and women, respectively, around the year 2000. Smoking habits account for a little more than half of these avoidable cases. Exposure to solar radiation, HPV and Helicobacter pylori, diagnostic and therapeutic radiation and consumption of alcohol play important roles in the causation of cancer, as each of these factors is linked with 1-5 percent of all cancers in men and women. Occupational exposures are also substantial causes in men (3 percent), and obesity is important in women (1 percent). In contrast, current knowledge is insufficient to give reliable estimates of the numbers of cancers that could be avoided by well-described modifications of dietary habits.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate subjective sleep quality and polysomnographic sleep structure features in patients with vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia (VCIND). METHODS: Fifty-six patients with VCIND, 48 patients with simple stroke (without cognitive impairment), and 48 control subjects were included. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and polysomnography (PSG) were used to analyze their sleep characteristics. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was conducted to assess mental state. RESULTS: Patients with VCIND had higher PSQI scores compared with control subjects and simple stroke patients (P<.01). PSG revealed that patients with VCIND or stroke were more likely to experience prolonged sleep latency (SL), decreased sleep efficiency (SE), increased arousal, and reduced deep sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep than controls. Patients with VCIND had significantly longer SL, increased periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS), decreased SE, and increased arousal and sleep fragmentation compared to patients with simple stroke (P<.05). In VCIND patients, a significant positive correlation was found between SE and MoCA scores (r=0.632; P<.001), though PSQI, SL, and arousal index were significantly negatively associated with MoCA scores (r=-0.787, -0.740, -0.772, respectively; P<.001 for all). CONCLUSIONS: VCIND patients had different abnormal sleep features, including decreased SE, increased PLMS, and prolonged SL and sleep fragmentation.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate subjective sleep quality and polysomnographic sleep structure features in patients with vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia (VCIND). METHODS: Fifty-six patients with VCIND, 48 patients with simple stroke (without cognitive impairment), and 48 control subjects were included. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and polysomnography (PSG) were used to analyze their sleep characteristics. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was conducted to assess mental state. RESULTS: Patients with VCIND had higher PSQI scores compared with control subjects and simple stroke patients (P<.01). PSG revealed that patients with VCIND or stroke were more likely to experience prolonged sleep latency (SL), decreased sleep efficiency (SE), increased arousal, and reduced deep sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep than controls. Patients with VCIND had significantly longer SL, increased periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS), decreased SE, and increased arousal and sleep fragmentation compared to patients with simple stroke (P<.05). In VCIND patients, a significant positive correlation was found between SE and MoCA scores (r=0.632; P<.001), though PSQI, SL, and arousal index were significantly negatively associated with MoCA scores (r=-0.787, -0.740, -0.772, respectively; P<.001 for all).

BACKGROUND: Diets high in fruits and vegetables have been shown to be associated with a lower risk of lung cancer. beta-Carotene was hypothesized to be largely responsible for the apparent protective effect, but this hypothesis was not supported by clinical trials. METHODS: We examined the association between lung cancer risk and fruit and vegetable consumption in 77 283 women in the Nurses' Health Study and 47 778 men in the Health Professionals' Follow-up Study. Diet was assessed with the use of a food-frequency questionnaire that included 15 fruits and 23 vegetables. We used logistic regression models to estimate relative risks (RRs) of lung cancer within each cohort. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We documented 519 lung cancer cases among the women and 274 among the men. Total fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with a modestly lower risk of lung cancer among the women but not among the men. The RR for the highest versus lowest quintile of intake was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.59-1.06) among the women and 1.12 (95% CI = 0.74-1.69) among the men after adjustment for smoking status, quantity of cigarettes smoked per day, time since quitting smoking, and age at initiation of smoking. However, total fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with a lower risk of lung cancer among never smokers in the combined cohorts, although the reduction was not statistically significant (RR = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.35-1.12 in the highest tertile). CONCLUSION: Higher fruit and vegetable intakes were associated with lower risks of lung cancer in women but not in men. It is possible that the inverse association among the women remained confounded by unmeasured smoking characteristics, although fruits and vegetables were protective in both men and women who never smoked."

BACKGROUND: Diets high in fruits and vegetables have been shown to be associated with a lower risk of lung cancer. beta-Carotene was hypothesized to be largely responsible for the apparent protective effect, but this hypothesis was not supported by clinical trials. METHODS: We examined the association between lung cancer risk and fruit and vegetable consumption in 77 283 women in the Nurses' Health Study and 47 778 men in the Health Professionals' Follow-up Study. Diet was assessed with the use of a food-frequency questionnaire that included 15 fruits and 23 vegetables. We used logistic regression models to estimate relative risks (RRs) of lung cancer within each cohort. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We documented 519 lung cancer cases among the women and 274 among the men. Total fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with a modestly lower risk of lung cancer among the women but not among the men. The RR for the highest versus lowest quintile of intake was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.59-1.06) among the women and 1.12 (95% CI = 0.74-1.69) among the men after adjustment for smoking status, quantity of cigarettes smoked per day, time since quitting smoking, and age at initiation of smoking.

Although cocaine is a well-recognized risk factor for coronary disease, detailed information is lacking regarding related behavioral and clinical features of cocaine-associated ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged urban settings. Nor are systematic or extended follow-up data available on outcomes for cocaine-associated STEMI in the contemporary era of percutaneous coronary intervention. We leveraged a prospective STEMI registry from a large health system serving an inner-city community to characterize the clinical features, acute management, and middle-term outcomes of cocaine-related versus cocaine-unrelated STEMI. Of the 1,003 patients included, 60% were black or Hispanic. Compared with cocaine-unrelated STEMI, cocaine-related STEMI (n = 58) was associated with younger age, male gender, lower socioeconomic score, current smoking, high alcohol consumption, and human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity but less commonly with diabetes or hypertension. Cocaine users less often received drug-eluting stents or beta blockers at discharge. During median follow-up of 2.7 years, rates of death, death or any rehospitalization, and death or cardiovascular rehospitalization did not differ significantly between cocaine users and nonusers but were especially high for death or any hospitalization in the 2 groups (31.4 vs 32.4 per 100 person-years, p = 0.887).

In conclusion, in this low-income community, cocaine use occurred in a substantial fraction of STEMI cases, who were younger than their nonuser counterparts but had more prevalent high-risk habits and exhibited similarly high rates of adverse outcomes.

osteoporosis	vitamin D	Statistically_associated	25060996	dev	T5	T6	320:332	361:370	"Low vitamin D levels are common in patients with epilepsy. 
PURPOSE: Vitamin D is important for bone health, and vitamin D deficiency may contribute to other disorders (e.g., autoimmune, infections, cancer, degenerative, diabetic, and vascular). Enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs have been particularly implicated for osteoporosis risk given their effects on vitamin D. We examined the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in adult epilepsy patients. METHODS: We conducted an observational study of consecutive epilepsy patients treated by two clinicians at the Emory University Epilepsy Center from 2008 to 2011 in order to determine the frequency of low vitamin D levels and possible differential antiepileptic drug risks. Vitamin D 25-OH levels were categorized as low (<20 ng/ml), borderline (20-29 ng/ml), or normal (>=30 ng/ml). Antiepileptic drugs were categorized based on their enzyme inducing properties. Descriptive and inferential statistics were employed. RESULTS: Vitamin D levels were obtained on 596 patients with epilepsy. Mean age was 41 years (SD=14; range=18-81); 56% were women. Race/ethnicity was 55% Caucasian, 34% Black, 2% Asian, and 7% Unknown. The mean vitamin D level was 22.5 (SD=11.9; range = <4 to 98), and 45% had level <20 ng/ml. Mean vitamin D levels (F=6.48, p=.002) and frequencies of vitamin D categories (p=.002, Chi square test) differed across the antiepileptic drug groups. Vitamin D deficiency was present in 54% of enzyme-inducing and 37% of non-enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs groups. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with epilepsy on antiepileptic drugs. Monitoring of vitamin D should be considered as part of the routine management of patients with epilepsy."

Consumption of vitamin D-supplemented food & drugs have increased significantly in the last couple of decades due to campaign and awareness programs. Despite such wide use of artificial vitamin D supplements, serum level of 25 hydroxyvitamin D does not always reflect the amount of uptake. In contrast to the safe sunlight exposure, prolonged and disproportionate consumption of vitamin D supplements may lead to vitamin D intoxication, even without developing hypervitaminosis D. One of the reasons why vitamin D supplementation is believed to be safe is, it rarely raises serum vitamin D levels to the toxic range even after repeated intravenous ingestion of extremely high doses of synthetic vitamin D analogs. However, prolonged consumption of vitamin D supplementation may induce hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia, which are considered to be the initial signs of vitamin D intoxication. It is likely that calcium and phosphorus dysregulation, induced by exogenous vitamin D supplementation, may lead to tissue and organ damages, even without developing hypervitaminosis D. It is needed to be emphasized that, because of tight homeostatic control of calcium and phosphorus, when hypercalcemia and/or hyperphosphatemia is apparent following vitamin D supplementation, the process of tissue and/or organ damage might already have been started."

gastritis	High-fat, high-cholesterol diet	positive_statistical_association	11397709	dev	T4	T1	59:68	0:31	"High-fat, high-cholesterol diet increases the incidence of gastritis in LDL receptor-negative mice. 
Transgenic and knockout mice are widely used as models for atherogenesis studies. While developing a Helicobacter infection model in LDL receptor-negative (LDLR(-/-)) mice, we noticed that mice fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet often contracted gastritis independent of infection. To further investigate this finding, we studied 27 male and 18 female LDLR(-/-) mice fed high-fat, 1% or 1.25% cholesterol diets for 3 to 4 months. The extent of atherosclerosis was morphometrically analyzed in the whole aorta, and the degree of gastric inflammation was scored histologically in hematoxylin-eosin-stained stomach sections. The autoantibody titers to epitopes of oxidized LDL were also measured. Mice fed high-fat, high-cholesterol diets had a significantly higher incidence of gastritis than mice fed normal chow, 62% versus 5%, respectively (P<0.0001). This effect was specific for LDLR(-/-) mice, because no difference in gastritis was found in wild-type mice fed either diet. Animals with gastritis showed slightly more atherosclerosis than animals without gastritis: 16.3+/-6.4% versus 12.8+/-3.4% in males and 9.4+/-3.5% versus 6.5+/-3.3% in females. Cholesterol-fed mice also had significantly higher IgG autoantibody titers against modified LDL than normal chow-fed animals, but no difference was seen between the gastritis and nongastritis groups. We conclude that the standard high-fat, high-cholesterol diet commonly used in many murine models to induce atherosclerosis increased the incidence of gastritis significantly in LDLR(-/-) mice."

Quality and number of subjects in blinded controlled clinical trials about the nutrition and dietary supplements discussed here is variable. Glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate have sufficient controlled trials to warrant their use in osteoarthritis, having less side effects than currently used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and are the only treatment shown to prevent progression of the disease. Dietary supplements of ephedrine plus caffeine for weight loss (weight loss being the current first line recommendation of physicians for osteoporosis) show some promise, but are not sufficient in number of study subjects. Phenylpropanolamine is proven successful in weight loss. Both ephedrine and phenylpropanolamine have resulted in deaths and hence are worrisome [table: see text] as an over-the-counter dietary supplement. Other commonly used weight loss supplements like Cola acuminata, dwarf elder, Yohimbine, and Garcinia camborgia are either lacking controlled clinical trials, or in the case of the last two supplements, have clinical trials showing lack of effectiveness (although Garcinia has been successful in trials as part of a mixture with other substances, it is unclear if it was a necessary part of the mixture). Safety of these weight loss supplements is unknown. Chromium as a body building supplement for athletes appears to have no efficacy. Creatine may help more in weight lifting than sprinting, but insufficient study subjects and safety information make more studies necessary. Carbohydrate loading is used commonly before endurance competitions, but may be underused as it may be beneficial for other sport performances. Supplements for muscle injury or cramps have had too few studies to determine efficacy. Although proper rehydration with fluids and electrolytes is necessary, a paucity of actual studies to maximize prophylactic treatment for exercise induced cramping still exists. Nutritional supplements for cardiovascular disorders are generally geared to prevention. The United States Department of Agriculture has good recommendations to prevent atherosclerosis; a stricter version by Ornish was shown to reverse coronary heart disease, and the low meat, high fruit, and vegetable DASH diet has been found to decrease hypertension. The epidemiologic studies of hyperhomocysteinemia are impressive enough to give folic acid (or vitamin B6 or B12) supplements to those with elevated homocysteine levels and test patients who have a history of atherosclerotic disease, but no controlled clinical trials have been completed. Soluble fiber has several positive studies in reduction of cholesterol levels and generally is accepted. The data on vitamin E are the most confusing. This vitamin was not helpful in cerebrovascular prevention in China and not helpful at relatively small doses (50 mg) in the United States or Finland against major coronary events. Levels of 400 mg appeared to decrease cardiovascular disease in the United States in studies based on reports by patients and in one large clinical trial. Vitamin E also was successful in prevention of restenosis after PTCA in one clinical trial. Both of these clinical trials need to be repeated in other developed country populations. Some nutritional and dietary supplements are justifiably useful at this point in time. Several meet the criteria of a late Phase 3 FDA clinical trial (where it would be released for public use), but many dietary supplements have insufficient numbers of studies. Some deaths also have occurred with some supplements. If these supplements were required to undergo clinical trials necessary for a new drug by the FDA, they would not be released yet to the public. Several nontoxic supplements appear promising, though need further study.

Quality and number of subjects in blinded controlled clinical trials about the nutrition and dietary supplements discussed here is variable. Glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate have sufficient controlled trials to warrant their use in osteoarthritis, having less side effects than currently used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and are the only treatment shown to prevent progression of the disease. Dietary supplements of ephedrine plus caffeine for weight loss (weight loss being the current first line recommendation of physicians for osteoporosis) show some promise, but are not sufficient in number of study subjects. Phenylpropanolamine is proven successful in weight loss. Both ephedrine and phenylpropanolamine have resulted in deaths and hence are worrisome [table: see text] as an over-the-counter dietary supplement. Other commonly used weight loss supplements like Cola acuminata, dwarf elder, Yohimbine, and Garcinia camborgia are either lacking controlled clinical trials, or in the case of the last two supplements, have clinical trials showing lack of effectiveness (although Garcinia has been successful in trials as part of a mixture with other substances, it is unclear if it was a necessary part of the mixture). Safety of these weight loss supplements is unknown. Chromium as a body building supplement for athletes appears to have no efficacy. Creatine may help more in weight lifting than sprinting, but insufficient study subjects and safety information make more studies necessary. Carbohydrate loading is used commonly before endurance competitions, but may be underused as it may be beneficial for other sport performances. Supplements for muscle injury or cramps have had too few studies to determine efficacy. Although proper rehydration with fluids and electrolytes is necessary, a paucity of actual studies to maximize prophylactic treatment for exercise induced cramping still exists. Nutritional supplements for cardiovascular disorders are generally geared to prevention. The United States Department of Agriculture has good recommendations to prevent atherosclerosis; a stricter version by Ornish was shown to reverse coronary heart disease, and the low meat, high fruit, and vegetable DASH diet has been found to decrease hypertension. The epidemiologic studies of hyperhomocysteinemia are impressive enough to give folic acid (or vitamin B6 or B12) supplements to those with elevated homocysteine levels and test patients who have a history of atherosclerotic disease, but no controlled clinical trials have been completed. Soluble fiber has several positive studies in reduction of cholesterol levels and generally is accepted. The data on vitamin E are the most confusing. This vitamin was not helpful in cerebrovascular prevention in China and not helpful at relatively small doses (50 mg) in the United States or Finland against major coronary events. Levels of 400 mg appeared to decrease cardiovascular disease in the United States in studies based on reports by patients and in one large clinical trial. Vitamin E also was successful in prevention of restenosis after PTCA in one clinical trial. Both of these clinical trials need to be repeated in other developed country populations. Some nutritional and dietary supplements are justifiably useful at this point in time. Several meet the criteria of a late Phase 3 FDA clinical trial (where it would be released for public use), but many dietary supplements have insufficient numbers of studies. Some deaths also have occurred with some supplements. If these supplements were required to undergo clinical trials necessary for a new drug by the FDA, they would not be released yet to the public. Several nontoxic supplements appear promising, though need further study.

OBJECTIVE: To compare sleep quality and fatigue between women with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) receiving hormone therapy (HT) and women of the same age with preserved ovarian function. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 61 women with POI receiving HT (POI group) and 61 women with preserved ovarian function (control group) who were matched by age (+/-2 years). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Chalder Fatigue Scale were used to assess sleep quality and fatigue. Apart from correlation analysis, the Mann-Whitney, chi-square, or Fisher test was used to compare the groups. RESULTS: Women from the POI and control groups were 35.03 +/- 7.68 and 34.49 +/- 7.55 years of age, respectively (P = 0.63). In the PSQI evaluation, the scores were 7.69 +/- 4.18 and 8.03 +/- 4.53, respectively (P = 0.79), showing no difference between the POI and control groups. However, the POI group had higher and therefore worse scores for the sleep latency component (1.74 +/- 0.66 and 1.18 +/- 0.87, respectively; P < 0.001) and use of medication to sleep (1.28 +/- 0.88 and 0. 85 +/- 0.8; P = 0.008). The POI group had a higher fatigue index than that of the control group (5.25 +/- 2.78 and 3.49 +/- 1.78, respectively; P < 0.001), with sleep quality being classified as poor in 69% and fatigue present in 59% of patients.

BACKGROUND: In several epidemiological studies, breast cancer risk has been reduced among women who reported high levels of occupational or leisure-time physical activity. We used data from a population-based case control study to evaluate the effect of occupational physical activity on breast cancer risk. METHODS: Two hundred-thirty three incident cases of breast cancer and 670 controls or their next of kin were interviewed for information on breast cancer risk factors and a complete job history. Physical activity level of jobs were classified using a Department of Labor rating scheme. We calculated adjusted odds ratios for light and medium/heavy activity jobs compared to sedentary jobs. RESULTS: Odds ratios for women who held medium/heavy jobs for less than 10 years and more than ten years were, respectively, 0.7 (95% CI = 0.4,1.3) and 1.7 (95% CI = 0.9,3.3). CONCLUSIONS: In these data there was no evidence that holding a job of medium/heavy activity reduced breast cancer risk. The study was limited by misclassification inherent in the occupational exposure scheme and by the lack of information on leisure time physical activity. The modest risk increase for subjects holding a medium/heavy job for at least 10 years probably represents either confounding or random variation."

BACKGROUND: Sleep disruption is pervasive in people with schizophrenia, but few studies have explored their sleep experiences. This study aims to identify factors relevant to sleep problems and explore coping methods used by community-dwelling people with schizophrenia. METHODS: Eighteen participants with schizophrenia were recruited from three mental health centers in Taiwan. They completed a semi-structured interview and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) assessment. The Person-Environment-Occupation model offered a framework to assess factors related to sleep. Thematic analysis was used for the qualitative data analysis. RESULTS: Factors related to sleep were classified under person, environment, and occupation domains. The person domain included three subthemes: psychiatric symptoms, unpleasant emotions, and frustration about sleep. The environment domain included three subthemes: sensory intrusions from the environment, quality of bedding, and roommates. The occupation domain included sleep interruption and sleep preparation. There were notable discrepancies in sleep quality between the participants' narratives and their PSQI global scores. Regarding coping methods for poor sleep, sleep medication was the primary strategy while some participants also used other strategies, such as modifying the environment, adjusting routines, or engaging in activities that improve sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric symptoms and nightmares were identified as unique sleep disruptions in people with schizophrenia, and poor economic status was also found to impact their sleep. The sleep quality of people with schizophrenia tends to be poor, as identified by the PSQI, even though they may have positive perceptions of their sleep quality. Our participants appeared to prefer to take hypnotics to address their sleep problems, which may be due to limited knowledge about alternatives. Mental health professionals are encouraged to receive training in the application of non-pharmacological approaches to support their clients' issues related to sleep."

Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer related deaths in the western world and smoking significantly increases the risk of developing lung cancer. Smoking enhances lung cancer initiation and progression. The effects of cigarette smoke on lung cancer are mediated by the presence of highly mutagenic substances, including nicotine, leading to mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. An emerging pathway in cancer is the Notch signaling pathway which is essential for embryonic lung development and tissue homeostasis. The role of Notch signaling in lung cancer remains controversial and no studies have directly linked cigarette exposure to mutations in Notch. Therefore, we investigated the direct effect of Notch signaling pathways on cigarette-induced lung tumors and the correlation between smoking and mutations in Notch leading to altered downstream signaling. Human cell lines, mouse models and clinical lung cancer samples were utilized in this study. Cigarette-induced in vitro human lung cancer models and in vivo mouse models demonstrated strong effects of cigarette exposure on the Notch signaling pathway. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of 50 clinical samples collected from smokers and non-smokers with and without lung cancer also demonstrated a link between smoking and changes in Notch signaling. Finally, 34 lung cancer samples analyzed through direct sequencing indicated smoking significantly increased small nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Notch 1 and 2 and specific SNPs significantly modulated expression levels of downstream signaling pathway molecules. Taken together, these results demonstrate a direct effect of smoking on the Notch signaling pathway leading to lung cancer initiation and progression."

obesity	sleep loss	positive_statistical_association	18929315	dev	T9	T8	832:839	790:800	"Metabolic consequences of sleep and sleep loss. 
Reduced sleep duration and quality appear to be endemic in modern society. Curtailment of the bedtime period to minimum tolerability is thought to be efficient and harmless by many. It has been known for several decades that sleep is a major modulator of hormonal release, glucose regulation and cardiovascular function. In particular, slow wave sleep (SWS), thought to be the most restorative sleep stage, is associated with decreased heart rate, blood pressure, sympathetic nervous activity and cerebral glucose utilization, compared with wakefulness. During SWS, the anabolic growth hormone is released while the stress hormone cortisol is inhibited. In recent years, laboratory and epidemiologic evidence have converged to indicate that sleep loss may be a novel risk factor for obesity and type 2 diabetes. The increased risk of obesity is possibly linked to the effect of sleep loss on hormones that play a major role in the central control of appetite and energy expenditure, such as leptin and ghrelin. Reduced leptin and increased ghrelin levels correlate with increases in subjective hunger when individuals are sleep restricted rather than well rested. Given the evidence, sleep curtailment appears to be an important, yet modifiable, risk factor for the metabolic syndrome, diabetes and obesity. The marked decrease in average sleep duration in the last 50 years coinciding with the increased prevalence of obesity, together with the observed adverse effects of recurrent partial sleep deprivation on metabolism and hormonal processes, may have important implications for public health."

bulimia nervosa	binge-eating	Causes	21418667	dev	T2	T3	65:80	155:167	"Bulimia nervosa. 
INTRODUCTION: Up to 1% of young women may have bulimia nervosa, characterised by an intense preoccupation with body weight, uncontrolled binge-eating episodes, and use of extreme measures to counteract the feared effects of overeating. People with bulimia nervosa may be of normal weight, making it difficult to diagnose. After 10 years, about half of people with bulimia nervosa will have recovered fully, one third will have made a partial recovery, and 10% to 20% will still have symptoms. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for bulimia nervosa in adults? What are the effects of discontinuing treatment in people with bulimia nervosa in remission? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 27 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; alone or plus exposure/response prevention enhancement), cognitive orientation therapy, dialectical behavioural therapy, discontinuing fluoxetine in people with remission, guided self-help cognitive behavioural therapy, hypnobehavioural therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, mirtazapine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), motivational enhancement therapy, pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, pure or unguided self-help cognitive behavioural therapy, reboxetine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), topiramate, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and venlafaxine."

Binge-eating disorder is characterized by binge behavior and loss of control of food intake, with an absence of purging. Eating disorders create significant mortality and morbidity. Medical complications associated with anorexia are those related to malnutrition and semistarvation. Medical complications associated with bulimia are those related to electrolyte imbalance and the physical effects of vomiting. The mortality rate of eating disorders may be as high as 15%, including deaths from arrhythmia, gastric hemorrhaging, and suicide. The core struggle within women with anorexia is the ""2 Ps"": feeling powerless and striving towards perfectionism. The core conflict within a bulimic person appears to be the ""2 Ds"": deprivation and dependency. The treatment of eating disorders includes psychotherapy, and, frequently, psychopharmacologic intervention. The psychotherapy primarily addresses issues of chaotic eating, hunger, inadequate caloric intake, conditioned response, and profound fear of expressing impulses and feelings, especially those of anger and sadness.

OBJECTIVE: To familiarize health care providers with diagnosis and treatment of binge-eating disorder (BED), a common comorbidity of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). METHODS: Literature review of binge eating and T2DM. Key words used in search include BED, T2DM, obesity, and treatment. RESULTS: The prevalence of BED in patients with T2DM appears to be much higher than the 2% to 3.5% prevalence seen in the general population. Studies suggest that up to 20% of patients with T2DM have an underlying eating disorder, the most common of which is binge eating. BED is probably underdiagnosed, even though there are multiple simple tools that providers can use to improve screening for the disorder. Though the relationship between BED and hemoglobin A1c control can vary, it appears that binge-eating behaviors can worsen metabolic markers, including glycemic control. Various medications used by patients with diabetes have been associated with new-onset BED, and treatment may be as simple as removing or replacing such agents. Several medications have been found to significantly reduce binge-eating frequency, and potentially, weight. Patients with BED generally benefit from psychotherapy, including cognitive behavioral therapy. CONCLUSION: BED, only recently added to the International Classification of Disease-10 diagnostic list, is very common in patients with obesity and T2DM.

Trichuris trichiura infection	drinking water resources	Statistically_associated	22263494	dev	T3	T29	613:642	703:727	"[Analysis of influencing factors of Trichuris trichiura infection in demonstration plots of comprehensive control of parasitic diseases]. 
OBJECTIVE: To understand the main risk factors of Trichuris trichiura infection in plots carrying out the integrated control of parasitic diseases. METHODS: The simple and multiple unconditional logistic regression were applied to analyze related data from the database of baseline survey in demonstration plots carrying out the integrated control of parasitic diseases. RESULTS: The results of simple logistic regression analysis suggested that the effects of 7 factors to Trichuris trichiura infection were significant (all P values were less than 0.05), namely drinking water resources, toilet type, fertilization type of farmland, fertilization type of vegetable field, washing hands after defecation, eating raw vegetables, melons and fruits and taking anthelminthic before examination. Among the factors above, eating raw vegetables, melons and fruits was of high risk (OR = 2.302), washing hands after defecation and taking anthelminthic before examination were two protection factors (with OR of 0.904 and 0.664, respectively). Compared to feces of human and livestock, fertilizing chemical fertilizer and compound fertilizer in farmland and vegetable field showed more obvious protection effect (with OR of 0.864 and 0.854, respectively). Drinking well water and spring water were two protection factors (with OR of 0.843 and 0.567, respectively). Simple toilet indoor and biogas pool also showed protection effect (with OR of 0.576 and 0.687, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that four factors including eating raw vegetables, melons and fruits, fertilization type of farmland, fertilization type of vegetable field and taking anthelminthic before examination were determined to be the main influencing factors of Trichuris trichiura infection. CONCLUSIONS: The main influencing factors of Trichuris trichiura infection in demonstration plots for the integrated control of parasitic diseases include eating raw vegetables, melons and fruits and fertilization type of farmland and vegetable field. Besides those, taking anthelminthic could reduce Trichuris trichiura infection of the population, meanwhile, sanitary water supply and latrine improvement could also reduce the risk of infection."

OBJECTIVE: To understand the main risk factors of Trichuris trichiura infection in plots carrying out the integrated control of parasitic diseases. METHODS: The simple and multiple unconditional logistic regression were applied to analyze related data from the database of baseline survey in demonstration plots carrying out the integrated control of parasitic diseases. RESULTS: The results of simple logistic regression analysis suggested that the effects of 7 factors to Trichuris trichiura infection were significant (all P values were less than 0.05), namely drinking water resources, toilet type, fertilization type of farmland, fertilization type of vegetable field, washing hands after defecation, eating raw vegetables, melons and fruits and taking anthelminthic before examination. Among the factors above, eating raw vegetables, melons and fruits was of high risk (OR = 2.302), washing hands after defecation and taking anthelminthic before examination were two protection factors (with OR of 0.904 and 0.664, respectively).

Besides those, taking anthelminthic could reduce Trichuris trichiura infection of the population, meanwhile, sanitary water supply and latrine improvement could also reduce the risk of infection."

OBJECTIVE: To understand the main risk factors of Trichuris trichiura infection in plots carrying out the integrated control of parasitic diseases. METHODS: The simple and multiple unconditional logistic regression were applied to analyze related data from the database of baseline survey in demonstration plots carrying out the integrated control of parasitic diseases. RESULTS: The results of simple logistic regression analysis suggested that the effects of 7 factors to Trichuris trichiura infection were significant (all P values were less than 0.05), namely drinking water resources, toilet type, fertilization type of farmland, fertilization type of vegetable field, washing hands after defecation, eating raw vegetables, melons and fruits and taking anthelminthic before examination. Among the factors above, eating raw vegetables, melons and fruits was of high risk (OR = 2.302), washing hands after defecation and taking anthelminthic before examination were two protection factors (with OR of 0.904 and 0.664, respectively). Compared to feces of human and livestock, fertilizing chemical fertilizer and compound fertilizer in farmland and vegetable field showed more obvious protection effect (with OR of 0.864 and 0.854, respectively). Drinking well water and spring water were two protection factors (with OR of 0.843 and 0.567, respectively). Simple toilet indoor and biogas pool also showed protection effect (with OR of 0.576 and 0.687, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that four factors including eating raw vegetables, melons and fruits, fertilization type of farmland, fertilization type of vegetable field and taking anthelminthic before examination were determined to be the main influencing factors of Trichuris trichiura infection.

Epidemiologic studies show strong associations between pancreatic cancer (PC) and inflammatory stimuli or conditions such as cigarette smoking and diabetes, suggesting that inflammation may play a key role in PC. Studies of dietary patterns and cancer outcomes also suggest that diet might influence an individual's risk of PC by modulating inflammation. We therefore examined independent and joint associations between inflammatory potential of diet, cigarette smoking and long-standing (>=5 years) type II diabetes in relation to risk of PC. Analyses included data from 817 cases and 1756 controls. Inflammatory potential of diet was measured using the dietary inflammatory index (DII), calculated from dietary intake assessed via a 144-item food frequency questionnaire, and adjusted for energy intake. Information on smoking and diabetes were obtained via risk factor questionnaires. Associations were examined using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. Higher DII scores, reflecting a more proinflammatory diet, were associated with increased risk of PC [odds ratio (OR)Quintile 5 versus 1 = 2.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.87-3.46, P trend < 0.0001]. Excess risk of PC also was observed among former (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.07-1.54) and current (OR = 3.40, 95% CI = 2.28-5.07) smokers compared with never smokers, and among participants with long-standing diabetes (OR = 3.09, 95% CI = 2.02-4.72) compared with nondiabetics. Joint associations were observed for the combined effects of having greater than median DII score, and being a current smoker (OR = 4.79, 95% CI = 3.00-7.65) or having long-standing diabetes (OR = 6.03, 95% CI = 3.41-10.85). These findings suggest that a proinflammatory diet may act as cofactor with cigarette smoking and diabetes to increase risk of PC beyond the risk of any of these factors alone."

Tobacco smoking is considered the greatest risk factor for death caused by noncommunicable diseases. In contrast to extensive research on the association between tobacco smoking and diseases such as heart attack, stroke, and cancers, studies on the association between tobacco smoking and seizures or epilepsy are insufficient. The exact roles tobacco smoking and nicotine use play in seizures or epilepsy have not been well reviewed. We reviewed available literature and found that 1) there are vast differences between tobacco smoke and nicotine based on their components and their effects on seizures or epilepsy; 2) the seizure risk in acute active tobacco smokers, women who smoke during pregnancy, electronic cigarette smokers, and the role of smoking in sudden unexplained/unexpected death in epilepsy remain unclear; 3) seizure risks are higher in acute secondhand smokers, chronic active smokers, and babies whose mothers smoke; 4) tobacco smoke protects against seizures in animal models whereas nicotine exerts mixed effects in animals; and 5) tobacco smoking agents can be noneffective, proconvulsant, or anticonvulsant.

AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the incidence and epidemiological characteristics of head and/or neck skin malignancies in Osijek-Baranja County, Croatia, and to connect them with relative climatic indicators such as the number and intensity of sunny and cloudy days over a longer period of time. METHODS: The study included patients from Osijek Baranja County with confirmed pathohistological diagnosis of the head and/or neck malignancies from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2012. The patients were analyzed according to gender, age, residence, occupation, type and location of the neoplasm, and hair and eye colour. The analysis of climatic elements (mean monthly and annual cloudiness values, mean monthly and annual sum values of sunny days) for a period of 50 years (1961-2011) based on the data of the Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service for the investigated area was performed. RESULTS: The study included a total of 2,952 patients: 1,487 (50.4%) males and 1,465 (49.6%) females, representing the estimated annual incidence of 104/100,000. The mean age was 72 years. The patients were mostly from rural areas, 1,952 (66.2%); 2,137 (72.4%) worked outdoors: 907 farmers (42.4%) and 889 construction workers (41.6%). Given the type of neoplasm, the most common was a basal cell cancer (BCC) in 2,160 patients (73.2%). Malignant melanoma was found in 93 patients (3.1%). The most common localizations were face (839 cases, 28.7%) and nose (643 cases, 22.0%). Males had a significantly higher number of planocellular malignancies--341 (56.6%) than females--262 (43.4%) (p=0.005). The median age of the patients was 67 years. There were no significant differences in types of malignancies, place of residence, workplace, or occupation (with respect to working outdoors or indoors). It has been shown that the ears and lips are significantly more affected by squamous cell malignancies (p=0.039 and p<0.001) compared to the neck, eye and head with malignant melanoma (p=0.004, p<0.001, and p=0.026) and the nose where basal cell neoplasms (p=0.002) prevail. There were no significant differences in the type and frequency of malignant neoplasms in relation to hair and eye colour of the patients. The last 50 years in Osijek-Baranja County have seen a declining trend in the number of cloudy days and upward trend in the mean annual sum of sunny days. When compared, the increase in sunny days results in a higher number of patients suffering from malignant melanoma (rho=0.695, p=0.038). CONCLUSION: It is obvious that malignant neoplasms of the skin, head and neck occur after decades of exposure, and as a cumulative effect of exposure to risk factors. A direct exposure to sun seems to play an important role, especially with regard to melanoma. Nevertheless, further research is needed."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate, among women with breast cancer, how postdiagnosis diet quality and the combination of diet quality and recreational physical activity are associated with prognosis. METHODS: This multiethnic, prospective observational cohort included 670 women diagnosed with local or regional breast cancer. Thirty months after diagnosis, women completed self-report assessments on diet and physical activity and were followed for 6 years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals for death from any cause and breast cancer death. RESULTS: Women consuming better-quality diets, as defined by higher Healthy Eating Index-2005 scores, had a 60% reduced risk of death from any cause (HR(Q4:Q1): 0.40, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.94) and an 88% reduced risk of death from breast cancer (HR(Q4:Q1): 0.12, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.99). Compared with inactive survivors consuming poor-quality diets, survivors engaging in any recreational physical activity and consuming better-quality diets had an 89% reduced risk of death from any cause (HR: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.36) and a 91% reduced risk of death from breast cancer (HR: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.89).

BACKGROUND: Dietary habits are established in childhood and will persist until adulthood, being one of the human health pillars. Many diseases of humans have roots in the individuals' diet, of which dental caries are one of the common infectious diseases. Diabetes Mellitus is also considered as the most common metabolic disorder in children. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the dietary patterns of children with type I Diabetes Mellitus with that of non-diabetic children, in relation to dental caries. MATERIALS/PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, 31 patients (13 boys and 18 girls, mean age of 11 +/- 5.4 years) with type I Diabetes Mellitus referred to the Diabetes Mellitus Center and university hospitals were selected. Controls were 31 healthy students matched for age and sex. The study was based on the data obtained from the questionnaire containing information about dietary patterns and oral hygiene habits, social class and decayed/missing/filled teeth (DMFT) index. Dietary patterns were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire developed on the basis of caries preventing or inducing foods and then scored. Data were analyzed by using the t-test and McNamara's test. RESULTS: Diabetic children had less frequent cariogenic snacks than their controls. The mean diet scores for diabetic and healthy subjects were 7.65 +/- 3.27 and 11.9 +/- 2.03 (P < 0.05), respectively. There was no significant difference in DMFT between the diabetics and controls (3.71 +/- 2.48 vs. 4.35 +/- 2.74, respectively). There were also no differences in frequency of tooth brushing and use of mouth washes. However, more diabetics reported that they have never used dental floss compared to controls (42.2% vs. 71%, P < 0.05). Having cheese with bread as snack was more prevalent in diabetics (P < 0.05).There was a positive correlation between DMFT and dietary scores (r = 0.3, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Controls scored higher in their dietary habits and dental flossing but lower in tooth brushing and mouth washing. More diabetics tend to have snacks like cheese and bread, which is a caries-preventing habit."

Controls were 31 healthy students matched for age and sex. The study was based on the data obtained from the questionnaire containing information about dietary patterns and oral hygiene habits, social class and decayed/missing/filled teeth (DMFT) index. Dietary patterns were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire developed on the basis of caries preventing or inducing foods and then scored. Data were analyzed by using the t-test and McNamara's test. RESULTS: Diabetic children had less frequent cariogenic snacks than their controls. The mean diet scores for diabetic and healthy subjects were 7.65 +/- 3.27 and 11.9 +/- 2.03 (P < 0.05), respectively. There was no significant difference in DMFT between the diabetics and controls (3.71 +/- 2.48 vs. 4.35 +/- 2.74, respectively). There were also no differences in frequency of tooth brushing and use of mouth washes. However, more diabetics reported that they have never used dental floss compared to controls (42.2% vs. 71%, P < 0.05). Having cheese with bread as snack was more prevalent in diabetics (P < 0.05).There was a positive correlation between DMFT and dietary scores (r = 0.3, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Controls scored higher in their dietary habits and dental flossing but lower in tooth brushing and mouth washing. More diabetics tend to have snacks like cheese and bread, which is a caries-preventing habit."

BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiologic study results showed that subjects who had high intakes of whole-grain foods had lower risks of death and heart disease than did subjects who had low intakes. However, the findings were inconsistent for fruit and vegetable intake. OBJECTIVE: The relations of whole-grain, refined-grain, and fruit and vegetable intakes with the risk of total mortality and the incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic stroke were studied in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort (baseline: age 45-64 y, n = 15,792). DESIGN: Proportional hazards regression analyses were used to assess the relations of whole-grain, refined-grain, and fruit and vegetable intakes with the risk of death and the incidence of CAD and ischemic stroke, with adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, energy intake, and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dietary intakes were assessed by using a food-frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Over an 11-y follow-up period, whole-grain intake was inversely associated with total mortality and incident CAD. The relative hazards of death for quintiles 2-5 of fruit and vegetable intake were 1.08 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.33), 0.94 (0.75, 1.17), 0.87 (0.68, 1.10), and 0.78 (0.61, 1.01), respectively; P for trend = 0.02. An inverse association between fruit and vegetable intake and CAD was observed among African Americans but not among whites (P for interaction = 0.01).

OBJECTIVE: The relations of whole-grain, refined-grain, and fruit and vegetable intakes with the risk of total mortality and the incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic stroke were studied in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort (baseline: age 45-64 y, n = 15,792). DESIGN: Proportional hazards regression analyses were used to assess the relations of whole-grain, refined-grain, and fruit and vegetable intakes with the risk of death and the incidence of CAD and ischemic stroke, with adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, energy intake, and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dietary intakes were assessed by using a food-frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Over an 11-y follow-up period, whole-grain intake was inversely associated with total mortality and incident CAD. The relative hazards of death for quintiles 2-5 of fruit and vegetable intake were 1.08 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.33), 0.94 (0.75, 1.17), 0.87 (0.68, 1.10), and 0.78 (0.61, 1.01), respectively; P for trend = 0.02. An inverse association between fruit and vegetable intake and CAD was observed among African Americans but not among whites (P for interaction = 0.01). The risk of ischemic stroke was not significantly related to whole-grain, refined-grain, or fruit and vegetable consumption. CONCLUSION: These observational findings suggest a beneficial effect of whole-grain and fruit and vegetable consumption on the risks of total mortality and incident CAD but not on the risk of ischemic stroke."

BACKGROUND: Hairdressers are at risk for occupational respiratory diseases, but the risk factors, causal agents, and underlying mechanisms are not completely defined. AIM: To describe the features of a large group of hairdressers consecutively referred to our center for suspected occupational asthma (OA) over an 8-year period, the type of occupational respiratory diseases, the etiologic agents, and the diagnostic tests. RESULTS: Forty-seven hairdressers (mean age, 25 years; range, 17 to 52 years) were studied. On the basis of the response to the specific inhalation challenge (SIC), 24 patients received a diagnosis of OA (51.1%), which was due to persulfate salts in 21 patients (87.5%), permanent hair dyes in 2 patients (8.3%), and latex in 1 patient (4.2%). Thirteen of these 24 patients (54.2%) also received a diagnosis of occupational rhinitis, which was due to persulfate salts in 11 patients (84.6%) and to paraphenylenediamine in two patients (15.4%). Patients with persulfate asthma had a long period of exposure to bleaching agents, a long latent period between the start of exposure and the onset of symptoms, and a prevalent eosinophilic airway inflammation in induced sputum. The skin-prick test with ammonium persulfate performed in a subset of patients gave negative results CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we confirmed that persulfate salts are the major agents involved in OA and occupational rhinitis in hairdressers.

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess subjective sleep quality and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to quantify glutamate in the bilateral anterior cingulate, left parietal cortex, and left hippocampus. Results indicate that global PSQI scores were negatively correlated with the anterior cingulate and parietal glutamate levels. In patients with schizophrenia, poorer sleep quality correlated with greater positive symptom severity. Our findings suggest that poor sleep quality is related to greater positive symptom severity and lower levels of anterior cingulate glutamate in individuals with schizophrenia. Interventions to enhance sleep quality may prove beneficial for patients. Future studies will examine whether glutamate relates to objective measures of sleep quality, and whether glutamate may mediate the relationship between sleep quality and symptom severity across the schizophrenia-spectrum."

BACKGROUND: Exposure to fluoride has been linked with increased prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the United States and symptoms of inattention in Mexican children. We examined the association between fluoride exposure and attention outcomes among youth living in Canada. METHOD: We used cross-sectional data collected from youth 6 to 17 years of age from the Canadian Health Measures Survey (Cycles 2 and 3). Urinary fluoride concentration adjusted for specific gravity (UFSG) was available for 1877 participants. Water fluoride concentration measured in tap water samples was available for 980 participants. Community water fluoridation (CWF) status was determined by viewing reports on each city's website or contacting the water treatment plant. We used logistic regression to test the association between the three measures of fluoride exposure and ADHD diagnosis. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship between the three measures of fluoride exposure and the hyperactivity/inattention score on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). RESULTS: UFSG did not significantly predict ADHD diagnosis or hyperactive/inattentive symptoms. A 1 mg/L increase in tap water fluoride level was associated with a 6.1 times higher odds of an ADHD diagnosis (95% CI = 1.60, 22.8). A significant interaction between age and tap water fluoride level (p = .03) indicated a stronger association between tap water fluoride and hyperactivity/inattention symptoms among older youth. A 1 mg/L increase in water fluoride level was associated with a 1.5 SDQ score increase (95% CI: 0.23, 2.68, p = .02) for youth at the 75th percentile of age (14 years old). Similarly, there was a significant interaction between age and CWF. At the 75th percentile of age (14 years old), those living in a fluoridated region had a 0.7-point higher SDQ score (95% CI = 0.34, 1.06, p < .01) and the predicted odds of an ADHD diagnosis was 2.8 times greater compared with youth in a non-fluoridated region (aOR = 2.84, 95% CI: 1.40, 5.76, p < .01). DISCUSSION: Exposure to higher levels of fluoride in tap water is associated with an increased risk of ADHD symptoms and diagnosis of ADHD among Canadian youth, particularly among adolescents. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these results."

Despite major advances in treating lung diseases, until now disease-modifying efficacy has not been demonstrated for any of the existing drugs. Current medical therapy offers only marginal benefit; therefore, there is an essential need to develop new drugs that might be of effective benefit in clinical settings. Over the years, there has been increasing evidence that curcumin, a phytochemical present in turmeric (Curcuma longa), has a wide spectrum of therapeutic properties and a remarkable range of protective effects in various diseases. Several experimental animal models have tested curcumin on lung fibrosis and these studies demonstrate that curcumin attenuates lung injury and fibrosis caused by radiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, and toxicants. The growing amount of data from pharmacological and animal studies also supports the notion that curcumin plays a protective role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and allergic asthma, its therapeutic action being on the prevention or modulation of inflammation and oxidative stress. These findings give substance to the possibility of testing curcumin in patients with lung diseases."

Probiotics are nonpathogenic microorganisms that confer a health benefit on the host when administered in adequate amounts. Ample evidence is documented to support the potential application of probiotics for the prevention and treatment of infections. Health benefits of probiotics include prevention of diarrhea, including antibiotic-associated diarrhea and traveler's diarrhea, atopic eczema, dental carries, colorectal cancers, and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The cumulative body of scientific evidence that demonstrates the beneficial effects of probiotics on health and disease prevention has made probiotics increasingly important as a part of human nutrition and led to a surge in the demand for probiotics in clinical applications and as functional foods. The ability of probiotics to promote health is attributed to the various beneficial effects exerted by these microorganisms on the host. These include lactose metabolism and food digestion, production of antimicrobial peptides and control of enteric infections, anticarcinogenic properties, immunologic enhancement, enhancement of short-chain fatty acid production, antiatherogenic and cholesterol-lowering attributes, regulatory role in allergy, protection against vaginal or urinary tract infections, increased nutritional value, maintenance of epithelial integrity and barrier, stimulation of repair mechanism in cells, and maintenance and reestablishment of well-balanced indigenous intestinal and respiratory microbial communities. Most of these attributes primarily focus on the effect of probiotic supplementation on the host. Hence, in most cases, it can be concluded that the ability of a probiotic to protect the host from infection is an indirect result of promoting overall health and well-being. However, probiotics also exert a direct effect on invading microorganisms. The direct modes of action resulting in the elimination of pathogens include inhibition of pathogen replication by producing antimicrobial substances like bacteriocins, competition for limiting resources in the host, antitoxin effect, inhibition of virulence, antiadhesive and antiinvasive effects, and competitive exclusion by competition for binding sites or stimulation of epithelial barrier function. Although much has been documented about the ability of probiotics to promote host health, there is limited discussion on the above mentioned effects of probiotics on pathogens. Being in an era of antibiotic resistance, a better understanding of this complex probiotic-pathogen interaction is critical for development of effective strategies to control infections. Therefore, this chapter will focus on the ability of probiotics to directly modulate the infectious nature of pathogens and the underlying mechanisms that mediate these effects."

BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are rising among Chinese reproductive-age women, while some studies have focused on the relationship between sedentary behavior and obesity in certain populations, none has focused on Chinese reproductive-age women specifically. This study examined secular trends in leisure time sedentary behaviors (watching television time, computer time and reading time, and the total sedentary time) among Chinese reproductive-age women and the association of those behaviors with five weight indicators-body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and overweight, obesity, and abdominal obesity status. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted with Chinese reproductive-age women aged 15-49 who had participated in two or more rounds of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), and completed the questionnaire and anthropometric measurements. The exposure variables were the average weekly time spent on three leisure time sedentary behaviors (watching television, using computer, and reading) and the total sedentary time (the sum of the above three sedentary time and video game time). Mixed-effect linear models were produced to explore the secular trends of the mean hours of these sedentary behaviors and the total sedentary time after adjusting covariates. Models were also produced to study the effects of these types of sedentary behavior levels on BMI and WC. Mixed-effect logistic regression models were produced to study the effects of the sedentary behavior levels on overweight, obesity, and abdominal obesity status. RESULTS: The total sedentary time among the reproductive-age women increased over time across most of age, region, educational levels, and income groups from 2004 to 2015. Television hours fluctuated, it increased and then declined over time across most of age, region, and income groups. Computer hours continually increased over time across all age, region, educational level, and income groups. Reading hours gradually decreased over time across most of age, region, educational level, and income groups. Those with a moderate level of television time (14 to <35 h/week) had 1.08 cm larger WCs and were 1.31 times more likely to have abdominal obesity than those with a low level of television time (<14 h/week). Those with a high level of television time (>=35 h/week) had 1.74 cm larger WCs, 0.66 kg/m(2) larger BMIs, were 1.50 times more likely to be overweight and were 1.47 times more likely to have abdominal obesity than those with a low level of television time (<14 h/week). Greater computer, reading time, and total sedentary time were not associated with WC, BMI, overweight, obesity, or abdominal obesity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings showed that among Chinese reproductive-age women ages 15-49, secular trends of computer time increased rapidly, reading time decreased gradually and television time fluctuated but showed not much difference from 2004 to 2015. The sharp increase in computer time far outweighed the decline in reading time. As a result, the overall sedentary behavior time of Chinese reproductive-age women gradually increased. These findings provided strong evidence that greater television time was significantly associated with higher BMI, WC, and higher risks of overweight, abdominal obesity among Chinese reproductive-age women. Computer, reading, and the total sedentary time were not associated with those weight indicators."

Television hours fluctuated, it increased and then declined over time across most of age, region, and income groups. Computer hours continually increased over time across all age, region, educational level, and income groups. Reading hours gradually decreased over time across most of age, region, educational level, and income groups. Those with a moderate level of television time (14 to <35 h/week) had 1.08 cm larger WCs and were 1.31 times more likely to have abdominal obesity than those with a low level of television time (<14 h/week). Those with a high level of television time (>=35 h/week) had 1.74 cm larger WCs, 0.66 kg/m(2) larger BMIs, were 1.50 times more likely to be overweight and were 1.47 times more likely to have abdominal obesity than those with a low level of television time (<14 h/week). Greater computer, reading time, and total sedentary time were not associated with WC, BMI, overweight, obesity, or abdominal obesity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings showed that among Chinese reproductive-age women ages 15-49, secular trends of computer time increased rapidly, reading time decreased gradually and television time fluctuated but showed not much difference from 2004 to 2015. The sharp increase in computer time far outweighed the decline in reading time. As a result, the overall sedentary behavior time of Chinese reproductive-age women gradually increased. These findings provided strong evidence that greater television time was significantly associated with higher BMI, WC, and higher risks of overweight, abdominal obesity among Chinese reproductive-age women. Computer, reading, and the total sedentary time were not associated with those weight indicators."

BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are rising among Chinese reproductive-age women, while some studies have focused on the relationship between sedentary behavior and obesity in certain populations, none has focused on Chinese reproductive-age women specifically. This study examined secular trends in leisure time sedentary behaviors (watching television time, computer time and reading time, and the total sedentary time) among Chinese reproductive-age women and the association of those behaviors with five weight indicators-body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and overweight, obesity, and abdominal obesity status. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted with Chinese reproductive-age women aged 15-49 who had participated in two or more rounds of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), and completed the questionnaire and anthropometric measurements. The exposure variables were the average weekly time spent on three leisure time sedentary behaviors (watching television, using computer, and reading) and the total sedentary time (the sum of the above three sedentary time and video game time). Mixed-effect linear models were produced to explore the secular trends of the mean hours of these sedentary behaviors and the total sedentary time after adjusting covariates. Models were also produced to study the effects of these types of sedentary behavior levels on BMI and WC. Mixed-effect logistic regression models were produced to study the effects of the sedentary behavior levels on overweight, obesity, and abdominal obesity status. RESULTS: The total sedentary time among the reproductive-age women increased over time across most of age, region, educational levels, and income groups from 2004 to 2015. Television hours fluctuated, it increased and then declined over time across most of age, region, and income groups.

Mixed-effect logistic regression models were produced to study the effects of the sedentary behavior levels on overweight, obesity, and abdominal obesity status. RESULTS: The total sedentary time among the reproductive-age women increased over time across most of age, region, educational levels, and income groups from 2004 to 2015. Television hours fluctuated, it increased and then declined over time across most of age, region, and income groups. Computer hours continually increased over time across all age, region, educational level, and income groups. Reading hours gradually decreased over time across most of age, region, educational level, and income groups. Those with a moderate level of television time (14 to <35 h/week) had 1.08 cm larger WCs and were 1.31 times more likely to have abdominal obesity than those with a low level of television time (<14 h/week). Those with a high level of television time (>=35 h/week) had 1.74 cm larger WCs, 0.66 kg/m(2) larger BMIs, were 1.50 times more likely to be overweight and were 1.47 times more likely to have abdominal obesity than those with a low level of television time (<14 h/week). Greater computer, reading time, and total sedentary time were not associated with WC, BMI, overweight, obesity, or abdominal obesity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings showed that among Chinese reproductive-age women ages 15-49, secular trends of computer time increased rapidly, reading time decreased gradually and television time fluctuated but showed not much difference from 2004 to 2015. The sharp increase in computer time far outweighed the decline in reading time. As a result, the overall sedentary behavior time of Chinese reproductive-age women gradually increased. These findings provided strong evidence that greater television time was significantly associated with higher BMI, WC, and higher risks of overweight, abdominal obesity among Chinese reproductive-age women. Computer, reading, and the total sedentary time were not associated with those weight indicators."

ARDS	air pollutant	Causes	30067389	dev	T21	T23	1769:1773	1698:1711	"Low to Moderate Air Pollutant Exposure and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Severe Trauma. 
RATIONALE: Exposure to air pollution has molecular and physiologic effects on the lung that may increase the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after injury. OBJECTIVES: To determine the association of short- and long-term air pollutant exposures and ARDS risk after severe trauma. METHODS: We analyzed data from a prospective cohort of 996 critically ill patients presenting with acute trauma and an injury severity score greater than 15. Exposures to ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter less than 2.5 mum were assessed by weighted averages of daily levels from all monitors within 50 km of the geocoded location of a patient's residence. Patients were followed for 6 days for the development of ARDS according to Berlin Criteria. The association between each exposure and ARDS was determined via multivariable logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: ARDS developed in 243 (24%) patients. None of the short-term exposures averaged over the 3 days before presentation was associated with ARDS, except sulfur dioxide, which demonstrated a nonlinear association. Nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 mum in aerodynamic diameter exposure over the 6 weeks before presentation was significantly associated with ARDS (P < 0.05). All long-term exposures (3 yr) were associated with ARDS (P < 0.01) in adjusted models, despite exposure levels largely below U.S. and European Union air quality standards. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term low- to moderate-level air pollutant exposure is associated with a greater risk of developing ARDS after severe trauma and represents a novel and potentially modifiable environmental risk factor for ARDS."

An increasing body of evidence points to a role for vitamin K in brain physiology through its participation in sphingolipid metabolism and biological activation of the vitamin K-dependent protein Gas6. One hypothesis is that vitamin K may also play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. A recent study found that patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease consumed less vitamin K than did cognitively intact control subjects. To learn more about the dietary intakes and food sources of vitamin K in these patients, a detailed analysis was conducted. Dietary vitamin K intakes were assessed from 5 nonconsecutive days of food records collected from 31 community-dwelling patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease and in 31 age- and sex-matched cognitively intact control subjects. Mean vitamin K intake on a person-day basis was 63+/-90 microg/day in patients and 139+/-233 microg/day in control subjects. Vitamin K intakes were significantly less in participants with Alzheimer's disease (P<0.0001), even after adjusting for energy intakes (P=0.0003). Vegetables, fats, and fruits contributed more than 70% of total vitamin K intake in both groups. The main source of vitamin K was green vegetables, which contributed 33% and 49% to total intakes in patients and control subjects, respectively. This lower consumption of green vegetables in participants with Alzheimer's disease explained their lower vitamin K intakes overall. Despite their limitations, results are in line with the most recent research in both vitamin K and Alzheimer's disease and suggest a need to consider vitamin K in future investigations on the role of diet in Alzheimer's disease."

Alzheimer's disease	vegetables	negative_statistical_association	19027415	dev	T21	T20	1473:1492	1441:1451	"Low vitamin K intakes in community-dwelling elders at an early stage of Alzheimer's disease. 
An increasing body of evidence points to a role for vitamin K in brain physiology through its participation in sphingolipid metabolism and biological activation of the vitamin K-dependent protein Gas6. One hypothesis is that vitamin K may also play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. A recent study found that patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease consumed less vitamin K than did cognitively intact control subjects. To learn more about the dietary intakes and food sources of vitamin K in these patients, a detailed analysis was conducted. Dietary vitamin K intakes were assessed from 5 nonconsecutive days of food records collected from 31 community-dwelling patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease and in 31 age- and sex-matched cognitively intact control subjects. Mean vitamin K intake on a person-day basis was 63+/-90 microg/day in patients and 139+/-233 microg/day in control subjects. Vitamin K intakes were significantly less in participants with Alzheimer's disease (P<0.0001), even after adjusting for energy intakes (P=0.0003). Vegetables, fats, and fruits contributed more than 70% of total vitamin K intake in both groups. The main source of vitamin K was green vegetables, which contributed 33% and 49% to total intakes in patients and control subjects, respectively. This lower consumption of green vegetables in participants with Alzheimer's disease explained their lower vitamin K intakes overall. Despite their limitations, results are in line with the most recent research in both vitamin K and Alzheimer's disease and suggest a need to consider vitamin K in future investigations on the role of diet in Alzheimer's disease."

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypotheses that insufficient duration, high fragmentation, and poor sleep quality are temporally associated with migraine onset on the day immediately following the sleep period (day 0) and the following day (day 1). METHODS: In this prospective cohort study of 98 adults with episodic migraine, participants completed twice-daily electronic diaries on sleep, headaches, and other health habits, and wore wrist actigraphs for 6 weeks. We estimated the incidence of migraine following nights with short sleep duration, high fragmentation, or low quality compared to nights with adequate sleep with conditional logistic regression models stratified by participant and adjusted for caffeine intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, stress, and day of week. RESULTS: Participants were a mean age of 35.1 +/- 12.1 years. We collected 4,406 days of data, with 870 headaches reported. Sleep duration <=6.5 hours and poor sleep quality were not associated with migraine on day 0 or day 1. Diary-reported low efficiency was associated with 39% higher odds of headache on day 1 (odds ratio [OR] 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.81). Actigraphic-assessed high fragmentation was associated with lower odds of migraine on day 0 (wake after sleep onset >53 minutes, OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48-0.86; efficiency <=88%, OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.99).

CONTEXT: Evidence is lacking that a dietary pattern high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber and low in total fat can influence breast cancer recurrence or survival. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a major increase in vegetable, fruit, and fiber intake and a decrease in dietary fat intake reduces the risk of recurrent and new primary breast cancer and all-cause mortality among women with previously treated early stage breast cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multi-institutional randomized controlled trial of dietary change in 3088 women previously treated for early stage breast cancer who were 18 to 70 years old at diagnosis. Women were enrolled between 1995 and 2000 and followed up through June 1, 2006. INTERVENTION: The intervention group (n = 1537) was randomly assigned to receive a telephone counseling program supplemented with cooking classes and newsletters that promoted daily targets of 5 vegetable servings plus 16 oz of vegetable juice; 3 fruit servings; 30 g of fiber; and 15% to 20% of energy intake from fat. The comparison group (n = 1551) was provided with print materials describing the ""5-A-Day"" dietary guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Invasive breast cancer event (recurrence or new primary) or death from any cause. RESULTS: From comparable dietary patterns at baseline, a conservative imputation analysis showed that the intervention group achieved and maintained the following statistically significant differences vs the comparison group through 4 years: servings of vegetables, +65%; fruit, +25%; fiber, +30%, and energy intake from fat, -13%. Plasma carotenoid concentrations validated changes in fruit and vegetable intake. Throughout the study, women in both groups received similar clinical care. Over the mean 7.3-year follow-up, 256 women in the intervention group (16.7%) vs 262 in the comparison group (16.9%) experienced an invasive breast cancer event (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-1.14; P = .63), and 155 intervention group women (10.1%) vs 160 comparison group women (10.3%) died (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-1.15; P = .43). No significant interactions were observed between diet group and baseline demographics, characteristics of the original tumor, baseline dietary pattern, or breast cancer treatment. CONCLUSION: Among survivors of early stage breast cancer, adoption of a diet that was very high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber and low in fat did not reduce additional breast cancer events or mortality during a 7.3-year follow-up period.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a 9-month pilot Internet randomized controlled trial (RCT) of cherry extract and diet modification in gout to assess the feasibility of an Internet study and obtain effect estimates. METHODS: After providing online informed consent in response to Internet advertisements and social media or clinic flyers, 84 people with physician-confirmed gout were randomized to either cherry extract 3,600 mg/d (n = 41) or dietitian-assisted diet modification for gout (n = 43). All study outcomes were collected via Internet and phone calls. The primary objective was the feasibility of an Internet study, and secondary objectives were to obtain effect estimates for gout flares, functional ability assessed with the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and adverse events (AEs) for future trials. RESULTS: Of the 84 people randomized, overall completion rates were more than 80% for most study procedures up to 6 months and similar for the 2 active comparators. Improvements were seen in gout flares and HAQ scores in cherry extract and diet modification groups at 9 months compared with baseline: gout flares per month, 0.22 versus 0.36 (p = 0.049) and 0.28 versus 0.31 (p = 0.76); proportion with any gout flare, 56% versus 98% (p < 0.0001) and 65% versus 98% (p = 0.0002); and mean +/- standard deviation HAQ score, 0.28 +/- 0.54 versus 0.55 +/- 0.68 (p = 0.001) and 0.23 +/- 0.40 versus 0.48 +/- 0.61 (p = 0.06), respectively. Any AEs and gastrointestinal symptoms/AEs at 9 months in cherry extract and diet modification groups were 3% versus 0% and 28% versus 27%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: An Internet gout RCT is feasible for nonpharmacological gout treatments. A hypothesis-testing, large Internet RCT of cherry extract versus placebo is needed."

METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the Pediatric and Dermatology Department, Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal. A total of 226 patients were examined over a period of one year. Relation of sociodemographics, crowding and personal hygiene on skin disease were assessed. RESULT: The most common category was Infections and Infestations (51.3%) followed by Dermatitis (27.9%). Transmissible skin disease was seen in 49.6%. Low socioeconomic status and overcrowding were associated with increased risk for infective dermatoses. CONCLUSION: Skin disease in children constitutes a public health problem. Improving the socioeconomic status and personal hygiene can help to reduce the incidence of skin disease in children."

BACKGROUND: The rapidly expanding gambling business has resulted in an increasing number of gamblers, and the problem is likely to get worse in the future. Traditionally, mood and gambling symptoms have been known to overlap. In the present review we attempt to examine the diagnostic associations and implications for treatment. METHOD: Selected published papers on the frequencies of mood disorders among patients who have gambling disorder or gambling disorder among patients who have mood disorder have been reviewed. Recently emerging new treatment methods for gambling disorder have been reviewed and a brief summary has been added. RESULTS: SCID based study results show a close link between gambling and mood disorders. The prevalence of manic disorder reaches to approximately one fourth of the pathological gambling disorder population. The prevalence of depression is much higher, reaching to over half of the population in some studies. LIMITATIONS: The studies included in the present paper involve inpatients, outpatients, subjects recruited through advertisements and prison populations. Thus the data need to be interpreted as such. Standardized assessment instruments are not used in all studies. Methodological issues such as primary or secondary nature of depression have not been addressed adequately in these studies. The findings, however, offer new insights for the assessment and treatment of complicated gambling disorder cases. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence rate of manic and depressive disorders has been recorded among pathological gambling disorder patients. A rational treatment approach to each defined subset of complicated gambling disorder is discussed."

Chronic periodontitis may be a sequela of chronic gingivitis, usually because of accumulation of plaque and calculus. Consistent good dental hygiene can help prevent gingivitis and periodontitis. Mechanical removal of plaque through frequent and efficacious brushing and flossing is the principal means of preventing periodontal diseases and diminishing the risk of caries. According to the American Dental Association (ADA), antimicrobial mouth-washes may provide additional oral health benefits, in addition to brushing and flossing, for preventing and reducing gingivitis and plaque. There is a multitude of mouthwashes available for these purposes. The consensus panel of the Middle East Oral Hygiene Advisory Board has recommended that an antiseptic mouthwash should be used as a daily adjunct to mechanical cleaning for prevention of oral disease. Recommending particular mouthwashes should take into consideration the patient's ability to perform good oral hygiene practices (tooth brushing and dental flossing), the condition of the patient's teeth, gingivae and oral mucosa, and the proven efficacy of the mouthwash along with its potential adverse effects. Of the many mouth rinses available, only a few contain chemical agents that have some ability to penetrate biofilm and to kill plaque biofilm bacteria. Currently, only chlorhexidine mouthrinse and Listerine (an essential oil-containing mouth rinse) products, with the claim of plaque and gingivitis reduction, have been accepted for that purpose by the ADA and have a proven record of safety and efficacy.

Chronic periodontitis may be a sequela of chronic gingivitis, usually because of accumulation of plaque and calculus. Consistent good dental hygiene can help prevent gingivitis and periodontitis. Mechanical removal of plaque through frequent and efficacious brushing and flossing is the principal means of preventing periodontal diseases and diminishing the risk of caries. According to the American Dental Association (ADA), antimicrobial mouth-washes may provide additional oral health benefits, in addition to brushing and flossing, for preventing and reducing gingivitis and plaque. There is a multitude of mouthwashes available for these purposes. The consensus panel of the Middle East Oral Hygiene Advisory Board has recommended that an antiseptic mouthwash should be used as a daily adjunct to mechanical cleaning for prevention of oral disease. Recommending particular mouthwashes should take into consideration the patient's ability to perform good oral hygiene practices (tooth brushing and dental flossing), the condition of the patient's teeth, gingivae and oral mucosa, and the proven efficacy of the mouthwash along with its potential adverse effects. Of the many mouth rinses available, only a few contain chemical agents that have some ability to penetrate biofilm and to kill plaque biofilm bacteria. Currently, only chlorhexidine mouthrinse and Listerine (an essential oil-containing mouth rinse) products, with the claim of plaque and gingivitis reduction, have been accepted for that purpose by the ADA and have a proven record of safety and efficacy.

We aimed to characterise the clinical and biochemical features of young children with rickets in a densely populated urban informal settlement in Kenya. Because malnutrition may mask the clinical features of rickets, we also looked for biochemical indices of risk in children with varying degrees of acute malnutrition. Twenty one children with rickets, aged 3 to 24 months, were identified on the basis of clinical and radiologic features, along with 22 community controls, and 41 children with either severe or moderate acute malnutrition. Most children with rickets had wrist widening (100%) and rachitic rosary (90%), as opposed to lower limb features (19%). Developmental delay (52%), acute malnutrition (71%), and stunting (62%) were common. Compared to controls, there were no differences in calcium intake, but most (71%) had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 30 nmol/L. These results suggest that rickets in young children in urban Kenya is usually driven by vitamin D deficiency, and vitamin D supplementation is likely to be required for full recovery.

hepatocellular adenoma	isoeugenol	Causes	21372857	test	T24	T61	6878:6900	6814:6824	"Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of isoeugenol (CAS No. 97-54-1) in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice (gavage studies). 
Isoeugenol is one of several structurally similar phenylpropenoid compounds produced by plants. It has been extracted from calamus, savory, basil, ylang-ylang, clove, tuberose, jonquil, nutmeg, tobacco, sandalwood, dill seed, mace, gardenia, petunia, and other flowers. Isoeugenol can also be produced by isomerization of eugenol, which occurs naturally in clove, pimento, bay leaf, and cinnamon. As a fragrance with a spicy, carnation-like odor, isoeugenol is incorporated into numerous household and personal hygiene products, including perfumes, cream lotions, soaps, and detergents. As a flavoring agent, isoeugenol is added to nonalcoholic drinks, baked foods, and chewing gums. Isoeugenol was nominated by the National Cancer Institute and was selected for carcinogenicity testing because of widespread human exposure through its use as a flavoring and fragrance agent and because of its structural similarity to phenylpropenoids such as safrole, isosafrole, eugenol, methyleugenol, estragole, and anethole, most of which are known rodent carcinogens. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were administered isoeugenol (99% or greater pure) in corn oil by gavage for 3 months or 2 years. Genetic toxicity tests were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 3-MONTH STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 37.5, 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. All rats survived to the end of the study except one 600 mg/kg male and one 37.5 mg/kg female that were killed in dosing accidents. Mean body weights of all exposed groups of males were significantly less than that of the vehicle control group; however, only the decrease for the 600 mg/kg group exceeded 10% and was considered related to isoeugenol exposure. Liver weights were significantly increased in 300 and 600 mg/kg females. The incidences of minimal atrophy of the olfactory epithelium of the nose were significantly increased in 150 mg/kg or greater males and in 300 or 600 mg/kg females. The incidence of atrophy of olfactory nerve bundles was significantly increased in 600 mg/kg females. Minimal to mild periportal hepatocellular cytoplasmic alteration occurred in all 300 or 600 mg/kg females. 3-MONTH STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 37.5, 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. All mice survived to the end of the study. The mean body weight of 600 mg/kg males was significantly less (12%) than that of the vehicle controls. Liver weights of 300 and 600 mg/kg males were significantly greater than those of the vehicle controls. Minimal to moderate atrophy of olfactory epithelial tissue and nerve bundles was observed in 600 mg/kg males and females. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 105 weeks. Survival rates of exposed male and female rats were similar to those of vehicle controls. Mean body weights of 300 mg/kg male rats were 9% greater than the vehicle controls at the end of the study. The general lack of toxicity and nonneoplastic lesions indicates that rats might have been able to tolerate higher doses. Two male rats in the 300 mg/kg group had rare benign or malignant thymomas, while two other males in this group had rare mammary gland carcinomas. Low incidences of minimal atrophy and minimal to mild respiratory metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium were increased in 150 mg/kg males and 300 mg/kg males and females. Similar incidences of minimal to mild olfactory epithelial degeneration in 300 mg/kg males were also increased. Incidences of keratoacanthoma of the skin were decreased in 150 and 300 mg/kg males. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 104 (females) or 105 (males) weeks. Survival of 300 mg/kg males was significantly decreased compared to the vehicle controls. Mean body weights of 300 mg/kg male and female groups were less than those of vehicle controls at the end of the study, 10% and 15% less, respectively. In all groups of exposed males, the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly greater than those in the vehicle control group; incidences of multiple hepatocellular adenoma were also significantly increased. Incidences of clear cell focus were significantly increased in 75 and 150 mg/kg male mice. There was a significant positive trend in the incidences of histiocytic sarcoma in females, and this neoplasm occurred in multiple tissues. Incidences of respiratory metaplasia in olfactory epithelium in all exposed groups and of atrophy and hyaline droplet accumulation in all exposed groups except 75 mg/kg females were significantly greater than those in corresponding vehicle control groups. Incidences of minimal to marked hyperplasia of Bowman's gland were increased significantly in all exposed groups. Incidences of minimal to mild necrosis of renal papilla and mild to moderate necrosis of renal tubules were increased significantly in 300 mg/kg females. Incidences of forestomach squamous hyperplasia, inflammation, and ulceration (males only) increased with exposure and were significant in the 300 mg/kg groups. The incidence of glandular stomach ulcers was low but significantly increased in the 300 mg/kg groups. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Isoeugenol was not mutagenic in two independent assays in bacteria (S. typhimurium and E. coli) conducted with and without exogenous metabolic activation (S9 liver enzymes). Neither did it induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with or without S9 activation. Frequencies of micronucleated erythrocytes were not increased in peripheral blood of male mice exposed to isoeugenol by gavage for 3 months; however, an increasing trend and a threefold increase in the 600 mg/kg group indicate a positive result for this test in female mice. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of rarely occurring thymoma and mammary gland carcinoma. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in female F344/N rats administered 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined). There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of histiocytic sarcoma. Exposure to isoeugenol resulted in nonneoplastic lesions of the nose in male and female rats; of the nose, forestomach, and glandular stomach in male and female mice; and of the kidney in female mice."

Isoeugenol is one of several structurally similar phenylpropenoid compounds produced by plants. It has been extracted from calamus, savory, basil, ylang-ylang, clove, tuberose, jonquil, nutmeg, tobacco, sandalwood, dill seed, mace, gardenia, petunia, and other flowers. Isoeugenol can also be produced by isomerization of eugenol, which occurs naturally in clove, pimento, bay leaf, and cinnamon. As a fragrance with a spicy, carnation-like odor, isoeugenol is incorporated into numerous household and personal hygiene products, including perfumes, cream lotions, soaps, and detergents. As a flavoring agent, isoeugenol is added to nonalcoholic drinks, baked foods, and chewing gums. Isoeugenol was nominated by the National Cancer Institute and was selected for carcinogenicity testing because of widespread human exposure through its use as a flavoring and fragrance agent and because of its structural similarity to phenylpropenoids such as safrole, isosafrole, eugenol, methyleugenol, estragole, and anethole, most of which are known rodent carcinogens. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were administered isoeugenol (99% or greater pure) in corn oil by gavage for 3 months or 2 years. Genetic toxicity tests were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 3-MONTH STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 37.5, 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. All rats survived to the end of the study except one 600 mg/kg male and one 37.5 mg/kg female that were killed in dosing accidents. Mean body weights of all exposed groups of males were significantly less than that of the vehicle control group; however, only the decrease for the 600 mg/kg group exceeded 10% and was considered related to isoeugenol exposure. Liver weights were significantly increased in 300 and 600 mg/kg females. The incidences of minimal atrophy of the olfactory epithelium of the nose were significantly increased in 150 mg/kg or greater males and in 300 or 600 mg/kg females. The incidence of atrophy of olfactory nerve bundles was significantly increased in 600 mg/kg females. Minimal to mild periportal hepatocellular cytoplasmic alteration occurred in all 300 or 600 mg/kg females. 3-MONTH STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 37.5, 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 14 weeks.

Mean body weights of 300 mg/kg male and female groups were less than those of vehicle controls at the end of the study, 10% and 15% less, respectively. In all groups of exposed males, the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly greater than those in the vehicle control group; incidences of multiple hepatocellular adenoma were also significantly increased. Incidences of clear cell focus were significantly increased in 75 and 150 mg/kg male mice. There was a significant positive trend in the incidences of histiocytic sarcoma in females, and this neoplasm occurred in multiple tissues. Incidences of respiratory metaplasia in olfactory epithelium in all exposed groups and of atrophy and hyaline droplet accumulation in all exposed groups except 75 mg/kg females were significantly greater than those in corresponding vehicle control groups. Incidences of minimal to marked hyperplasia of Bowman's gland were increased significantly in all exposed groups. Incidences of minimal to mild necrosis of renal papilla and mild to moderate necrosis of renal tubules were increased significantly in 300 mg/kg females. Incidences of forestomach squamous hyperplasia, inflammation, and ulceration (males only) increased with exposure and were significant in the 300 mg/kg groups. The incidence of glandular stomach ulcers was low but significantly increased in the 300 mg/kg groups. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Isoeugenol was not mutagenic in two independent assays in bacteria (S. typhimurium and E. coli) conducted with and without exogenous metabolic activation (S9 liver enzymes). Neither did it induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with or without S9 activation. Frequencies of micronucleated erythrocytes were not increased in peripheral blood of male mice exposed to isoeugenol by gavage for 3 months; however, an increasing trend and a threefold increase in the 600 mg/kg group indicate a positive result for this test in female mice. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of rarely occurring thymoma and mammary gland carcinoma. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in female F344/N rats administered 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined). There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of histiocytic sarcoma. Exposure to isoeugenol resulted in nonneoplastic lesions of the nose in male and female rats; of the nose, forestomach, and glandular stomach in male and female mice; and of the kidney in female mice."

Isoeugenol is one of several structurally similar phenylpropenoid compounds produced by plants. It has been extracted from calamus, savory, basil, ylang-ylang, clove, tuberose, jonquil, nutmeg, tobacco, sandalwood, dill seed, mace, gardenia, petunia, and other flowers. Isoeugenol can also be produced by isomerization of eugenol, which occurs naturally in clove, pimento, bay leaf, and cinnamon. As a fragrance with a spicy, carnation-like odor, isoeugenol is incorporated into numerous household and personal hygiene products, including perfumes, cream lotions, soaps, and detergents. As a flavoring agent, isoeugenol is added to nonalcoholic drinks, baked foods, and chewing gums. Isoeugenol was nominated by the National Cancer Institute and was selected for carcinogenicity testing because of widespread human exposure through its use as a flavoring and fragrance agent and because of its structural similarity to phenylpropenoids such as safrole, isosafrole, eugenol, methyleugenol, estragole, and anethole, most of which are known rodent carcinogens. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were administered isoeugenol (99% or greater pure) in corn oil by gavage for 3 months or 2 years. Genetic toxicity tests were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 3-MONTH STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 37.5, 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. All rats survived to the end of the study except one 600 mg/kg male and one 37.5 mg/kg female that were killed in dosing accidents. Mean body weights of all exposed groups of males were significantly less than that of the vehicle control group; however, only the decrease for the 600 mg/kg group exceeded 10% and was considered related to isoeugenol exposure. Liver weights were significantly increased in 300 and 600 mg/kg females. The incidences of minimal atrophy of the olfactory epithelium of the nose were significantly increased in 150 mg/kg or greater males and in 300 or 600 mg/kg females. The incidence of atrophy of olfactory nerve bundles was significantly increased in 600 mg/kg females. Minimal to mild periportal hepatocellular cytoplasmic alteration occurred in all 300 or 600 mg/kg females. 3-MONTH STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 37.5, 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. All mice survived to the end of the study. The mean body weight of 600 mg/kg males was significantly less (12%) than that of the vehicle controls. Liver weights of 300 and 600 mg/kg males were significantly greater than those of the vehicle controls. Minimal to moderate atrophy of olfactory epithelial tissue and nerve bundles was observed in 600 mg/kg males and females. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 105 weeks. Survival rates of exposed male and female rats were similar to those of vehicle controls. Mean body weights of 300 mg/kg male rats were 9% greater than the vehicle controls at the end of the study. The general lack of toxicity and nonneoplastic lesions indicates that rats might have been able to tolerate higher doses. Two male rats in the 300 mg/kg group had rare benign or malignant thymomas, while two other males in this group had rare mammary gland carcinomas. Low incidences of minimal atrophy and minimal to mild respiratory metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium were increased in 150 mg/kg males and 300 mg/kg males and females. Similar incidences of minimal to mild olfactory epithelial degeneration in 300 mg/kg males were also increased. Incidences of keratoacanthoma of the skin were decreased in 150 and 300 mg/kg males. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 104 (females) or 105 (males) weeks.

Incidences of forestomach squamous hyperplasia, inflammation, and ulceration (males only) increased with exposure and were significant in the 300 mg/kg groups. The incidence of glandular stomach ulcers was low but significantly increased in the 300 mg/kg groups. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Isoeugenol was not mutagenic in two independent assays in bacteria (S. typhimurium and E. coli) conducted with and without exogenous metabolic activation (S9 liver enzymes). Neither did it induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with or without S9 activation. Frequencies of micronucleated erythrocytes were not increased in peripheral blood of male mice exposed to isoeugenol by gavage for 3 months; however, an increasing trend and a threefold increase in the 600 mg/kg group indicate a positive result for this test in female mice. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of rarely occurring thymoma and mammary gland carcinoma. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in female F344/N rats administered 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined). There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoeugenol in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of histiocytic sarcoma. Exposure to isoeugenol resulted in nonneoplastic lesions of the nose in male and female rats; of the nose, forestomach, and glandular stomach in male and female mice; and of the kidney in female mice."

Isoeugenol is one of several structurally similar phenylpropenoid compounds produced by plants. It has been extracted from calamus, savory, basil, ylang-ylang, clove, tuberose, jonquil, nutmeg, tobacco, sandalwood, dill seed, mace, gardenia, petunia, and other flowers. Isoeugenol can also be produced by isomerization of eugenol, which occurs naturally in clove, pimento, bay leaf, and cinnamon. As a fragrance with a spicy, carnation-like odor, isoeugenol is incorporated into numerous household and personal hygiene products, including perfumes, cream lotions, soaps, and detergents. As a flavoring agent, isoeugenol is added to nonalcoholic drinks, baked foods, and chewing gums. Isoeugenol was nominated by the National Cancer Institute and was selected for carcinogenicity testing because of widespread human exposure through its use as a flavoring and fragrance agent and because of its structural similarity to phenylpropenoids such as safrole, isosafrole, eugenol, methyleugenol, estragole, and anethole, most of which are known rodent carcinogens. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were administered isoeugenol (99% or greater pure) in corn oil by gavage for 3 months or 2 years. Genetic toxicity tests were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 3-MONTH STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 37.5, 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. All rats survived to the end of the study except one 600 mg/kg male and one 37.5 mg/kg female that were killed in dosing accidents. Mean body weights of all exposed groups of males were significantly less than that of the vehicle control group; however, only the decrease for the 600 mg/kg group exceeded 10% and was considered related to isoeugenol exposure. Liver weights were significantly increased in 300 and 600 mg/kg females. The incidences of minimal atrophy of the olfactory epithelium of the nose were significantly increased in 150 mg/kg or greater males and in 300 or 600 mg/kg females. The incidence of atrophy of olfactory nerve bundles was significantly increased in 600 mg/kg females. Minimal to mild periportal hepatocellular cytoplasmic alteration occurred in all 300 or 600 mg/kg females. 3-MONTH STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 37.5, 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. All mice survived to the end of the study. The mean body weight of 600 mg/kg males was significantly less (12%) than that of the vehicle controls. Liver weights of 300 and 600 mg/kg males were significantly greater than those of the vehicle controls. Minimal to moderate atrophy of olfactory epithelial tissue and nerve bundles was observed in 600 mg/kg males and females. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 105 weeks. Survival rates of exposed male and female rats were similar to those of vehicle controls. Mean body weights of 300 mg/kg male rats were 9% greater than the vehicle controls at the end of the study. The general lack of toxicity and nonneoplastic lesions indicates that rats might have been able to tolerate higher doses. Two male rats in the 300 mg/kg group had rare benign or malignant thymomas, while two other males in this group had rare mammary gland carcinomas. Low incidences of minimal atrophy and minimal to mild respiratory metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium were increased in 150 mg/kg males and 300 mg/kg males and females. Similar incidences of minimal to mild olfactory epithelial degeneration in 300 mg/kg males were also increased. Incidences of keratoacanthoma of the skin were decreased in 150 and 300 mg/kg males. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were exposed to isoeugenol in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 104 (females) or 105 (males) weeks. Survival of 300 mg/kg males was significantly decreased compared to the vehicle controls. Mean body weights of 300 mg/kg male and female groups were less than those of vehicle controls at the end of the study, 10% and 15% less, respectively. In all groups of exposed males, the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly greater than those in the vehicle control group; incidences of multiple hepatocellular adenoma were also significantly increased. Incidences of clear cell focus were significantly increased in 75 and 150 mg/kg male mice. There was a significant positive trend in the incidences of histiocytic sarcoma in females, and this neoplasm occurred in multiple tissues. Incidences of respiratory metaplasia in olfactory epithelium in all exposed groups and of atrophy and hyaline droplet accumulation in all exposed groups except 75 mg/kg females were significantly greater than those in corresponding vehicle control groups. Incidences of minimal to marked hyperplasia of Bowman's gland were increased significantly in all exposed groups. Incidences of minimal to mild necrosis of renal papilla and mild to moderate necrosis of renal tubules were increased significantly in 300 mg/kg females. Incidences of forestomach squamous hyperplasia, inflammation, and ulceration (males only) increased with exposure and were significant in the 300 mg/kg groups.

obesity	sugar-sweetened beverages	positive_statistical_association	20074393	test	T18	T17	1652:1659	1585:1610	"Risk factors for childhood obesity in a Greek paediatric population. 
OBJECTIVE: Obesity in children is a serious public health issue in Greece. The purpose of the current study was to identify risk factors such as birth weight, breast-feeding, dietary patterns, family history of obesity and sedentary behaviours that are possibly associated with paediatric obesity. DESIGN: Two hundred and five overweight and obese children (OW/OB; group 1) aged 7-15 years from eight primary and secondary schools and a control group (group 2) of normal-weight children were matched for age and sex. Overweight and obesity were calculated based on the International Obesity Taskforce criteria. Lifestyle parameters as well as anthropometric data were collected in all children. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for obesity. RESULTS: Breast-feeding (> or =3 months) and leisure-time physical activity proved to be protector factors against obesity (OR = 0.21, 95 % CI 0.11, 0.79, P < 0.001 and OR = 0.87, 95 % CI 0.85, 0.89, P < 0.001 respectively). On the other hand, family history of obesity (OR = 3.79, 95 % CI 2.61, 4.18, P < 0.001), sugar-sweetened beverage consumption (OR = 1.77, 95 % CI 1.03, 2.76, P < 0.001) and watching television (OR = 1.99, 95 % CI 1.54, 2.76, P = 0.04) were found to be positively associated with a higher obesity risk. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings support the literature according to which duration of breast-feeding (<3 months), a family history of obesity, watching television, sedentary lifestyle and consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages are important risk factors for childhood obesity. More studies are needed to elucidate the relationship of paediatric obesity and possible predictor factors in order to avoid health consequences in these children later on in life."

OBJECTIVE: Obesity in children is a serious public health issue in Greece. The purpose of the current study was to identify risk factors such as birth weight, breast-feeding, dietary patterns, family history of obesity and sedentary behaviours that are possibly associated with paediatric obesity. DESIGN: Two hundred and five overweight and obese children (OW/OB; group 1) aged 7-15 years from eight primary and secondary schools and a control group (group 2) of normal-weight children were matched for age and sex. Overweight and obesity were calculated based on the International Obesity Taskforce criteria. Lifestyle parameters as well as anthropometric data were collected in all children. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for obesity. RESULTS: Breast-feeding (> or =3 months) and leisure-time physical activity proved to be protector factors against obesity (OR = 0.21, 95 % CI 0.11, 0.79, P < 0.001 and OR = 0.87, 95 % CI 0.85, 0.89, P < 0.001 respectively). On the other hand, family history of obesity (OR = 3.79, 95 % CI 2.61, 4.18, P < 0.001), sugar-sweetened beverage consumption (OR = 1.77, 95 % CI 1.03, 2.76, P < 0.001) and watching television (OR = 1.99, 95 % CI 1.54, 2.76, P = 0.04) were found to be positively associated with a higher obesity risk. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings support the literature according to which duration of breast-feeding (<3 months), a family history of obesity, watching television, sedentary lifestyle and consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages are important risk factors for childhood obesity. More studies are needed to elucidate the relationship of paediatric obesity and possible predictor factors in order to avoid health consequences in these children later on in life."

Chronic stress is a combination of nonspecific adaptive reactions of the body to the influence of various adverse stress factors which disrupt its homeostasis, and it is also a corresponding state of the organism's nervous system (or the body in general). We hypothesized that chronic stress may be one of the causes occurence of several molecular and cellular types of stress. We analyzed literary sources and considered most of these types of stress in our review article. We examined genes and mutations of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes and also molecular variants which lead to various types of stress. The end result of chronic stress can be metabolic disturbance in humans and animals, leading to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress, energy deficiency in cells (due to a decrease in ATP synthesis) and mitochondrial dysfunction. These changes can last for the lifetime and lead to severe pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases and atherosclerosis. The analysis of literature allowed us to conclude that under the influence of chronic stress, metabolism in the human body can be disrupted, mutations of the mitochondrial and nuclear genome and dysfunction of cells and their compartments can occur. As a result of these processes, oxidative, genotoxic, and cellular stress can occur. Therefore, chronic stress can be one of the causes forthe occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases and atherosclerosis. In particular, chronic stress can play a large role in the occurrence and development of oxidative, genotoxic, and cellular types of stress."

INTRODUCTION: The hygiene hypothesis proposes that reduced exposure to infections in early life increases the risk of developing allergic conditions including allergic rhinitis. We examined the association between markers of the hygiene hypothesis and allergic rhinitis that developed before 7 years of age and allergic rhinitis that developed after 7 years of age. METHODS: The Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study (TAHS) is a population-based cohort (n=8583) study of respiratory disease. Participants have been followed from 7 to 44 years of age. Information on potential risk factors, allergies and respiratory symptoms was collected longitudinally. Using multi-nomial logistic regression, exposure to siblings, infections, tonsillectomy and farm residence during childhood were examined as risk factors for allergic rhinitis that developed before or after 7 years of age. All analyses were adjusted for gender, maternal and paternal atopy, mother's age at participant's birth, paternal socio-economic status in 1968 and personal socio-economic status in 2004. RESULTS: Greater cumulative exposure to siblings before the age of 2 years was strongly inversely associated with early onset allergic rhinitis (<1 year sib exposure: OR=0.6, 95% CI 0.3-1.0; 1-3 years sib exposure: OR=0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9; >3 years sib exposure: OR=0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.8) less so with later onset allergic rhinitis. The risk of early onset allergic rhinitis decreased with increasing viral infections (OR=0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9) during childhood. Having a tonsillectomy before 7 years of age increased the risk of early onset allergic rhinitis (OR=1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.5). None of these factors was associated with later onset allergic rhinitis. CONCLUSIONS: Exposures relevant to the hygiene hypothesis were important predictors for the development of early onset but less so for later onset allergic rhinitis. The exact mechanisms by which siblings and infections protect against allergic rhinitis are unclear. The stronger findings for earlier onset allergic rhinitis suggest that family structure and infections have most impact on disease risk in early life. Further research should focus on early onset allergic rhinitis when exploring causal explanations for any sibling effect."

ABSRACT Exposure to artificial light at night (ALAN) has been reported to be associated with various pathological changes including sleep deprivation, circadian rhythm disruption, and melatonin suppression with increase in various cancers such as breast or prostate cancers. In this study, we sought to elucidate the association between ALAN and prostate cancer in 27 districts within Gwangju City and urban and rural areas from South Jeolla Province in South Korea. We analyzed the correlation between ALAN and the incidence of a range of cancers by Poisson regression analysis, after adjustment for confounding risk factors, such as smoking, drinking, obesity, stress, air pollution (particulate matter <10 mum in diameter), urbanization (proportion of urbanized area), and the cancer screening rate. Interestingly, the incidence of prostate cancer was significantly associated with ALAN (risk ratio = 1.02, p = 0.0369) and urbanization (risk ratio = 1.06, p = 0.0055). In particular, comparing the prostate cancer incidence at 25% and 75% level of ALAN, the risk ratio was 1.726 (12.6 over 7.3, respectively). No significant association was observed between ALAN and other cancers, including stomach, esophageal, liver, pancreatic, laryngeal, lung and tracheal, bladder, and brain and central nervous system cancers, as well as lymphoma and multiple myeloma. In conclusion, this study shows that a high incidence of prostate cancer may be independently associated with light pollution and urbanization, which represent significant factors in the rapid process of industrialization of South Korea."

We analyzed the correlation between ALAN and the incidence of a range of cancers by Poisson regression analysis, after adjustment for confounding risk factors, such as smoking, drinking, obesity, stress, air pollution (particulate matter <10 mum in diameter), urbanization (proportion of urbanized area), and the cancer screening rate. Interestingly, the incidence of prostate cancer was significantly associated with ALAN (risk ratio = 1.02, p = 0.0369) and urbanization (risk ratio = 1.06, p = 0.0055). In particular, comparing the prostate cancer incidence at 25% and 75% level of ALAN, the risk ratio was 1.726 (12.6 over 7.3, respectively). No significant association was observed between ALAN and other cancers, including stomach, esophageal, liver, pancreatic, laryngeal, lung and tracheal, bladder, and brain and central nervous system cancers, as well as lymphoma and multiple myeloma. In conclusion, this study shows that a high incidence of prostate cancer may be independently associated with light pollution and urbanization, which represent significant factors in the rapid process of industrialization of South Korea."

BACKGROUND: Exposure to occupational noise might increase the risk of hypertension. However, limited cohort studies have investigated the relationship between time-varying exposure to occupational noise and the development of hypertension. METHODS: We conducted a 17-year cohort study involving 2459 workers to assess the relationship between time-varying exposure to occupational noise and incident hypertension in the aerospace industry. We performed an extended Cox proportional hazard model considering occupational noise exposure as time-varying covariates. Furthermore, we employed the distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMS) to examine the exposure-response relationship. RESULTS: In the extended Cox proportional model, as workers were exposed to noise over 80 dBA, the hazard ratios (HRs) of hypertension significantly increased with a noise increase of 5 dBA (HR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04-1.29). In exposure-response associations, the HRs of hypertension steadily increased between noise levels of 82 and 106 dBA (HRs ranged from 1.04 to 1.46). After additionally adjusting for personal protection equipment (PPE), the HRs decreased dramatically between 107 and 124 dBA (HRs ranged from 1.45 to 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Our study refined the exposure assessment by integrating time-varying exposures to occupational noise and taking work history into consideration. Our findings suggested that workers exposed to noise levels between 82 and 106 dBA for 3-17 years may increase the risk of hypertension with a non-linear exposure-response pattern. We further provided evidence that workers wearing PPE could effectively reduce noise exposure and avoid the development of hypertension."

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent evidence on the effect of cleaning jobs on asthma, based on case reports and series of occupational asthma among cleaners, and epidemiological studies on the relationship between different characteristics of cleaning and asthma risk, as well as to elaborate the evidence on potential occupational exposures responsible for the increased asthma risk observed in cleaners. RECENT FINDINGS: Six recent epidemiologic studies strengthen the evidence that domestic and industrial cleaners are at higher risk of asthma compared with professional employees in Europe and the United States. These studies take into account individual confounders, such as age and cigarette smoking. This finding is supported by case reports and registry-based studies of occupational asthma. The studies and reports have identified some chemicals, such as bleach, as specific causes of asthma.

RECENT FINDINGS: Six recent epidemiologic studies strengthen the evidence that domestic and industrial cleaners are at higher risk of asthma compared with professional employees in Europe and the United States. These studies take into account individual confounders, such as age and cigarette smoking. This finding is supported by case reports and registry-based studies of occupational asthma. The studies and reports have identified some chemicals, such as bleach, as specific causes of asthma.

malaria	variations in the nutritional status	Causes	17116632	test	T13	T14	3061:3068	3140:3176	"[Assessment of 24 years of infant growth monitoring in a rural area of Senegal (1969-1992)]. 
Undernutrition in young children in developing countries is associated with an increased risk of death. But in several studies, a decrease in mortality was not associated with any decrease in the prevalence of undernutrition. STUDY AREA: A rural population of Casamance (Senegal) has been under yearly demographic surveillance by The French National Institute of Demographic Studies (INED) since 1985. Between 1960-1964 and 1990-1994, under-5 and child (1-4 years) mortality rates dropped from 312 to 127 and from 201 to 68 per 1,000, respectively. Since 1961, French Catholic nuns who are also professional nurses have been in charge of a private village dispensary located in a rural area of Casamance. This dispensary delivers permanent, high quality service and is widely attended. GROWTH MONITORING PROGRAMME: A growth-monitoring programme, supported by Cathwell, was initiated in 1969 for 0-5-year-old children (0-3 from 1985). Children were weighed wearing light clothes to the nearest 10g. Weights were recorded in a register that also contained information concerning identity (name, sex, date of birth) and address. All weights were plotted on growth charts kept by the mothers. During the sessions, the nurses provided nutrition education messages (i.e., preparation of high-energy and nutrient-dense infant gruels using local foods), advice on illness management (oral rehydration during diarrhoea) and hygiene (well and water-jar disinfection, construction of pit-latrines), importance of vaccination. From 1975, they also distributed free chloroquine during the malaria transmission season (May-November) for prevention and early presumptive treatment. Most likely thanks to this programme, infant and child mortality reached a low level at the end of the 1980s. In 1990, plasmodium resistance to chloroquine appeared, increasing malaria mortality. METHODS: All weight measurements taken in 1969-1994 were entered into a database. This paper presents an analysis of weight measurements taken at 3-23 months of age from 1969-1992. A total of 4,636 infants were weighed at least once, but only 3,912 infants (1,983 boys and 1,929 girls) were available for the analysis, 724 being excluded due to missing data. RESULTS: The average coverage of the programme during the month of February was 88% for infants aged 3-23 months. Mean weight was examined at three target ages: 5, 11 and 15 months. Not only did the nutritional status not improve between 1969 and 1989, it even deteriorated in some years for all three age-cohorts. The nutritional status of infants in this community did not differ significantly from that of 12-23 month-old Senegalese children in the 1992-1993 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). Seasonal differences in mean weight and the prevalence of underweight became significant in the rainy season since 1975. Underweight for the 15-month-old children increased over time during the rainy season. These findings were unexpected, since malaria morbidity is thought to be at least partially responsible for seasonal variations in the nutritional status of young children, and despite the fact that the nurses began a malaria control programme in 1975. CONCLUSION: The rapid transition towards lower childhood mortality observed in this rural area of Casamance (Senegal), was not concomitant with any improvement in infants' nutritional status from 1969 through 1992. Focused public health interventions such as vaccinations and malaria prevention probably did not improve the nutritional status. Paradoxically, growth monitoring may have been more helpful in improving health than growth. Targeted specific nutritional interventions are needed to significantly improve growth of children in this community."
ovarian cancer	flaxseed	Treats	20153884	test	T25	T24	1675:1689	1641:1649	"Decreased severity of ovarian cancer and increased survival in hens fed a flaxseed-enriched diet for 1 year. 
OBJECTIVE: With the exception of the laying hen, no other animal model of spontaneous ovarian surface epithelial cancer replicates the human disease. Flaxseed is the richest vegetable source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are chemopreventive in breast cancer and may be important in other cancers. The objective of this study was to determine if a flaxseed-enriched diet had a chemopreventive effect on ovarian cancer in the laying hen. METHODS: White Leghorn hens were fed with 10% flaxseed-enriched or standard diet for 1 year. The incidence and severity of ovarian cancer were determined by gross pathology and histology in the two groups. General health markers were also measured. Eggs were collected and analyzed by gas chromatography to determine omega-3 fatty acid levels. RESULTS: A significant reduction in late stage ovarian tumors was detected in the flaxseed-fed hens. Incidence rates of ovarian cancer were not significantly different between the two groups. The results indicate that a flaxseed diet increases overall survival in the laying hen. Flaxseed-fed hens' eggs incorporated significantly more omega-3 fatty acids compared to control hens. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that 10% flaxseed supplementation for 1 year in the laying hen results in a significant reduction in the severity of ovarian cancer, but no change in the incidence of the disease. Hens fed flaxseed had overall better health and reduced mortality. These findings may provide the basis for a clinical trial that evaluates the efficacy of flaxseed as a chemosuppressant of ovarian cancer in women."

uterine cancer	sleep deprivation	Causes	34595604	test	T14	T15	1827:1841	1864:1881	"Sleep deprivation and quality of life among uterine cancer survivors: systematic review. 
INTRODUCTION: While cancer survival might be a relief from a near-death health condition, the after-recovery period also predisposes the survivors to deteriorated quality of life as well as sleep deprivation. Patients with cancer may experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) throughout the diagnostic process and even after diagnosis is completed, especially when facing the possibility of tumor recurrence. Survivors, in particular, are frequently in a condition of uncertainty due to the 15 to 20% chance of recurrence within 3 years of the main treatment. Despite the high rate of cancer survival, which is believed to be around 83%, assessing quality of life after a cancer diagnosis can help to improve such results. PURPOSE: This article aimed to describe the sleep patterns among uterine cancer survivors and verify psychological and physical factors affecting their general qualities of life. According to the qualitative study, uterine cancer survivors who receive treatment, whether pharmaceutical or therapeutic, have a higher quality of life than those who do not. METHOD: PRISMA reporting was used for this systematic review. Electronic databases that were searched include PubMed, Cochrane Trial Register, and ScienceDirect for studies evaluating the sleep deprivation and quality of life among uterine cancer survivors. Ten publications were chosen based on inclusion criteria that included uterine cancer survivors who had finished their treatments and addressed sleep quality or overall quality of life. RESULTS: The main finding of the systematic review is that 61% of uterine cancer survivors had poor sleep quality, and 81% have a decreased quality of life. CONCLUSION: According to the most recent research, uterine cancer survivors suffer from sleep deprivation, which leads to a lower quality of life. However, the same study reveals that uterine cancer survivors suffering with sleep loss use a variety of cognitive behavioral therapy to improve their quality of life. Maintaining a healthy diet, incorporating physical activity into daily routines, receiving cognitive behavior therapy, participating in relevant training programs, and obtaining frequent depression and sexual health screenings are just a few of the CBT mechanisms mentioned."

Background: Cardiac arrest during or after office-based cosmetic surgery is rare, and little is known about its prognosis. We assessed the clinical outcomes of patients who developed cardiac arrest during or after cosmetic surgery at office-based clinics. Methods: Between May 2009 and May 2016, 32 patients who developed cardiac arrest during or after treatment at cosmetic surgery clinics were consecutively enrolled. We compared clinical outcomes, including complications, between survivors (n=19) and non-survivors (n=13) and attempted to determine the prognostic factors of mortality. Results: All 32 of the patients were female, with a mean age of 30.40+/-11.87 years. Of the 32 patients, 13 (41%) died. Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) was applied in a greater percentage of non-survivors than survivors (92.3% vs. 47.4%, respectively; p=0.009). The mean duration of in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was longer for the non-survivors than the survivors (31.55+/-33 minutes vs. 7.59+/-9.07 minutes, respectively; p=0.01). The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score was also higher among non-survivors than survivors (23.85+/-6.68 vs. 16.79+/-7.44, respectively; p=0.01). No predictor of death was identified in the patients for whom ECLS was applied. Of the 19 survivors, 10 (52.6%) had hypoxic brain damage, and 1 (5.3%) had permanent lower leg ischemia. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the estimated glomerular filtration rate was a predictor of mortality. Conclusion: Patients who developed cardiac arrest during or after cosmetic surgery at office-based clinics experienced poor prognoses, even though ECLS was applied in most cases. The survivors suffered serious complications. Careful monitoring of subjects and active CPR (when necessary) in cosmetic surgery clinics may be essential."

BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that exposure to ambient air pollution during pregnancy may be associated with increased risks of birth defects (BDs), but conclusions have been inconsistent. This study describes the ethnic distribution of major BDs and examines the relationship between air pollution and BDs among different ethnic groups in Liuzhou city, China. METHODS: Surveillance data of infants born in 114 registered hospitals in Liuzhou in 2019 were analyzed to determine the epidemiology of BDs across five major ethnic groups. Concentrations of six air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, O3) were obtained from the Liuzhou Environmental Protection Bureau. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations between ambient air pollution exposure and risk of BDs. RESULTS: Among 32,549 infants, 635 infants had BDs, yielding a prevalence of 19.5 per 1000 perinatal infants. Dong ethnic group had the highest prevalence of BDs (2.59%), followed by Yao (2.57%), Miao (2.35%), Zhuang (2.07%), and Han (1.75%). Relative to the Han ethnic group, infants from Zhuang, Miao, Yao and Dong groups had lower risks of congenital heart disease, polydactyly, and hypospadias. The Zhuang ethnic group had higher risks of severe thalassemia, cleft lip and/or palate, and syndactyls. Overall BDs were positively correlated with air pollutants PM10 (aOR =1.14, 95% CI:1.12 ~ 2.43; aOR =1.51, 95% CI:1.13 ~ 2.03 for per 10mug/mg3 increment) and CO (aOR =1.36, 95% CI:1.14 ~ 2.48; aOR =1.75, 95% CI:1.02 ~ 3.61 for every 1 mg /m3 increment) in second and third month of pregnancy. SO2 was also significantly associated with BDs in the second month before the pregnancy (aOR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.20 ~ 3.22) and third month of pregnancy (aOR =1.75; 95% CI:1.02 ~ 3.61). Congenital heart disease, polydactyl, cleft lip and/or palate were also significantly associated with PM10, SO2 and CO exposures. However, no significant association was found between birth defects and O3, PM2.5 and NO2 exposures (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study provides a comprehensive description of ethnic differences in BDs in Southwest China and broadens the evidence of the association between air pollution exposure during gestation and BDs."

BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that exposure to ambient air pollution during pregnancy may be associated with increased risks of birth defects (BDs), but conclusions have been inconsistent. This study describes the ethnic distribution of major BDs and examines the relationship between air pollution and BDs among different ethnic groups in Liuzhou city, China. METHODS: Surveillance data of infants born in 114 registered hospitals in Liuzhou in 2019 were analyzed to determine the epidemiology of BDs across five major ethnic groups. Concentrations of six air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, O3) were obtained from the Liuzhou Environmental Protection Bureau. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations between ambient air pollution exposure and risk of BDs. RESULTS: Among 32,549 infants, 635 infants had BDs, yielding a prevalence of 19.5 per 1000 perinatal infants. Dong ethnic group had the highest prevalence of BDs (2.59%), followed by Yao (2.57%), Miao (2.35%), Zhuang (2.07%), and Han (1.75%). Relative to the Han ethnic group, infants from Zhuang, Miao, Yao and Dong groups had lower risks of congenital heart disease, polydactyly, and hypospadias. The Zhuang ethnic group had higher risks of severe thalassemia, cleft lip and/or palate, and syndactyls. Overall BDs were positively correlated with air pollutants PM10 (aOR =1.14, 95% CI:1.12 ~ 2.43; aOR =1.51, 95% CI:1.13 ~ 2.03 for per 10mug/mg3 increment) and CO (aOR =1.36, 95% CI:1.14 ~ 2.48; aOR =1.75, 95% CI:1.02 ~ 3.61 for every 1 mg /m3 increment) in second and third month of pregnancy. SO2 was also significantly associated with BDs in the second month before the pregnancy (aOR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.20 ~ 3.22) and third month of pregnancy (aOR =1.75; 95% CI:1.02 ~ 3.61). Congenital heart disease, polydactyl, cleft lip and/or palate were also significantly associated with PM10, SO2 and CO exposures.

This study describes the ethnic distribution of major BDs and examines the relationship between air pollution and BDs among different ethnic groups in Liuzhou city, China. METHODS: Surveillance data of infants born in 114 registered hospitals in Liuzhou in 2019 were analyzed to determine the epidemiology of BDs across five major ethnic groups. Concentrations of six air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, O3) were obtained from the Liuzhou Environmental Protection Bureau. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations between ambient air pollution exposure and risk of BDs. RESULTS: Among 32,549 infants, 635 infants had BDs, yielding a prevalence of 19.5 per 1000 perinatal infants. Dong ethnic group had the highest prevalence of BDs (2.59%), followed by Yao (2.57%), Miao (2.35%), Zhuang (2.07%), and Han (1.75%). Relative to the Han ethnic group, infants from Zhuang, Miao, Yao and Dong groups had lower risks of congenital heart disease, polydactyly, and hypospadias. The Zhuang ethnic group had higher risks of severe thalassemia, cleft lip and/or palate, and syndactyls. Overall BDs were positively correlated with air pollutants PM10 (aOR =1.14, 95% CI:1.12 ~ 2.43; aOR =1.51, 95% CI:1.13 ~ 2.03 for per 10mug/mg3 increment) and CO (aOR =1.36, 95% CI:1.14 ~ 2.48; aOR =1.75, 95% CI:1.02 ~ 3.61 for every 1 mg /m3 increment) in second and third month of pregnancy. SO2 was also significantly associated with BDs in the second month before the pregnancy (aOR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.20 ~ 3.22) and third month of pregnancy (aOR =1.75; 95% CI:1.02 ~ 3.61). Congenital heart disease, polydactyl, cleft lip and/or palate were also significantly associated with PM10, SO2 and CO exposures. However, no significant association was found between birth defects and O3, PM2.5 and NO2 exposures (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study provides a comprehensive description of ethnic differences in BDs in Southwest China and broadens the evidence of the association between air pollution exposure during gestation and BDs."

bladder cancer	married	Controls	19219612	test	T18	T34	2173:2187	2151:2158	"Impact of marital status in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer. 
PURPOSE: Married (vs. unmarried) individuals have improved health status and longer life expectancies in a variety of benign and malignant disease states, including prostate, breast, head/neck, and lung cancers. We sought to evaluate a cohort of patients undergoing cystectomy for bladder cancer to evaluate the impact of marital status on demographic, peri-operative, and pathological outcomes in order to better understand the factors which may contribute to the survival differences observed. METHODS: Two-hundred and two patients underwent radical cystectomy and urinary diversion for bladder cancer. Patients were categorized based on marital status as either married or unmarried (widowed, divorced, never married). Correlations were made to demographic factors (age, race, gender, BMI, tobacco use, alcohol use), perioperative factors (pre-op renal function (creatinine), hematocrit, EBL, hospital stay, choice of diversion), and pathological outcomes (organ-confined status, LN positivity). RESULTS: Of the 202 patients, 74% were married. Married individuals (vs. unmarried) were more often male (84 vs. 62%) and had a higher BMI (28.1 vs. 25.9). Married persons had a significantly lower pre-op creatinine (1.1 vs. 1.4) and higher hematocrit (39 vs. 34). Hospital stay was shorter in married patients by a mean of 1.6 days. Regarding operative pathology, married patients had a higher rate of organ-confined disease (59 vs. 47%) (P = 0.05, 0.08 on multivariate) and trended towards a lower rate of LN positivity (15 vs. 21%; P = 0.10, 0.12 multivariate). CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing cystectomy for bladder cancer, married individuals appear to have improved pre-operative laboratory variables, shorter hospitalization, and improved pathological outcomes versus unmarried patients in our case series. These findings may support the evidence (observed in other tumor types and other disease states) that married persons present earlier than unmarried individuals, and this may help explain the improved survival outcomes that have been observed in married patients with bladder cancer."

Exposure to ambient PM2.5 pollution has been linked to multiple adverse health effects. Additional effects have been identified in the literature and there is a need to understand its potential role in high prevalence diseases. In response to recent indications of PM2.5 as a risk factor for dementia, we examine the evidence by systematically reviewing the epidemiologic literature, in relation to exposure from ambient air pollution, household air pollution, secondhand smoke, and active smoking. We develop preliminary exposure-response functions, estimate the uncertainty, and discuss sensitivities and model selection. We estimate the likely impact to be 2.1 M (1.4 M, 2.5 M; 5%-95% confidence) global incident dementia cases and 0.6 M (0.4 M, 0.8 M) deaths attributable to ambient PM2.5 pollution in 2015. This implies a combined toll from morbidity and mortality of dementia of 7.3 M (5.0 M, 9.1 M) lost disability-adjusted life years. China, Japan, India, and the United States had the highest estimated total burden, and the per capita burden was highest in developed countries with large elderly populations. Compared to 2000, most countries in Europe, the Americas, and Southern Africa reduced the burden in 2015, while other regions had a net increase. Based on a recent systematic review of cost of illness studies for dementia, our estimates imply economic costs of US$ 26 billion worldwide in 2015. Based on this estimation, ambient PM2.5 pollution may be responsible for 15% of premature deaths and 7% of DALYs associated with dementia. Our estimates also indicate substantial uncertainty in this relationship, and future epidemiological studies at high exposure levels are especially needed."

NCDs	ambient air pollution	positive_statistical_association	29150201	test	T17	T7	2319:2323	2524:2545	"Nations within a nation: variations in epidemiological transition across the states of India, 1990-2016 in the Global Burden of Disease Study. 
BACKGROUND: 18% of the world's population lives in India, and many states of India have populations similar to those of large countries. Action to effectively improve population health in India requires availability of reliable and comprehensive state-level estimates of disease burden and risk factors over time. Such comprehensive estimates have not been available so far for all major diseases and risk factors. Thus, we aimed to estimate the disease burden and risk factors in every state of India as part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2016. METHODS: Using all available data sources, the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative estimated burden (metrics were deaths, disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs], prevalence, incidence, and life expectancy) from 333 disease conditions and injuries and 84 risk factors for each state of India from 1990 to 2016 as part of GBD 2016. We divided the states of India into four epidemiological transition level (ETL) groups on the basis of the ratio of DALYs from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNNDs) to those from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries combined in 2016. We assessed variations in the burden of diseases and risk factors between ETL state groups and between states to inform a more specific health-system response in the states and for India as a whole. FINDINGS: DALYs due to NCDs and injuries exceeded those due to CMNNDs in 2003 for India, but this transition had a range of 24 years for the four ETL state groups. The age-standardised DALY rate dropped by 36.2% in India from 1990 to 2016. The numbers of DALYs and DALY rates dropped substantially for most CMNNDs between 1990 and 2016 across all ETL groups, but rates of reduction for CMNNDs were slowest in the low ETL state group. By contrast, numbers of DALYs increased substantially for NCDs in all ETL state groups, and increased significantly for injuries in all ETL state groups except the highest. The all-age prevalence of most leading NCDs increased substantially in India from 1990 to 2016, and a modest decrease was recorded in the age-standardised NCD DALY rates. The major risk factors for NCDs, including high systolic blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, high total cholesterol, and high body-mass index, increased from 1990 to 2016, with generally higher levels in higher ETL states; ambient air pollution also increased and was highest in the low ETL group. The incidence rate of the leading causes of injuries also increased from 1990 to 2016. The five leading individual causes of DALYs in India in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, and cerebrovascular disease; and the five leading risk factors for DALYs in 2016 were child and maternal malnutrition, air pollution, dietary risks, high systolic blood pressure, and high fasting plasma glucose. Behind these broad trends many variations existed between the ETL state groups and between states within the ETL groups. Of the ten leading causes of disease burden in India in 2016, five causes had at least a five-times difference between the highest and lowest state-specific DALY rates for individual causes. INTERPRETATION: Per capita disease burden measured as DALY rate has dropped by about a third in India over the past 26 years. However, the magnitude and causes of disease burden and the risk factors vary greatly between the states. The change to dominance of NCDs and injuries over CMNNDs occurred about a quarter century apart in the four ETL state groups. Nevertheless, the burden of some of the leading CMNNDs continues to be very high, especially in the lowest ETL states. This comprehensive mapping of inequalities in disease burden and its causes across the states of India can be a crucial input for more specific health planning for each state as is envisioned by the Government of India's premier think tank, the National Institution for Transforming India, and the National Health Policy 2017.

sleep disorder	awaking from night sleep	Causes	18229663	test	T16	T29	1404:1418	1514:1538	"The sleep habits and sleep disorders in children with headache. 
PURPOSE: The study was conducted to examine the sleep habits and sleep disorders in children and adolescents with headache. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three hundred children with headache were qualified to a headache group (HG) and 284 children from schools and kindergartens without headache to a control group (CG). RESULTS: In our study, 27.7% children of the HG slept together with other person in the bed; 18.7% of the CG. In the HG, 11.7% of children had physical contact with parents when falling asleep, in the CG 19.7%. In the HG, watching TV and listening to the radio when falling asleep occurred more frequently. About 20% of parents in the HG read aloud to children before putting them to sleep, in the CG 32.4%. Day naps occurred in 32.7% of the HG children and in 20.1% of the CG. Sleep disorders reported in the study group as parasomnia symptoms included: sleep talking 48.3% (CG 38.7%); bruxism 23.3% (CG 16.5%); leg movement 20.3% (CG 18.0%); nightmares 16.7% (CG 7.4%) and sleep breathing disorder symptoms like snoring 27.3% in the HG group (CG 19.0%) and breathing pauses 5.7% (CG 1.4%). Awakenings from the night sleep were observed in 43.7% children of the HG and in 36.4% children of the CG. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep habits in children with headache were considerably different from sleep habits in the CG. The prevalence of sleep disorder symptoms like: snoring, sleep talking, bruxism, sleep terror, nightmares, breathing pauses and awaking from night sleep was higher in the HG group than in the CG."
common cold	probiotics	Controls	23372900	test	T19	T18	1547:1558	1513:1523	"The effect of probiotics on prevention of common cold: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial studies. 
BACKGROUND: Probiotics are currently under focus for their immune improvement function. Many studies have been performed to assess the potential efficacy of probiotics in allergic disease, viral disease, respiratory disease, as well as gastrointestinal disease. This study performed a systematic review to determine the effects of probiotics on the prevention of the common cold. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL for studies released through June 2011. Two authors independently extracted the data. To assess the risk of bias of included literatures, Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool was used. RESULTS: We identified 10 studies in 7 articles. A total 2,894 participants, 1,588 in the probiotics group and 1,306 in the control group, were included. The effect of probiotics on the prevention of the common cold had a relative risk (RR) of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.00, I(2) = 26%). In the subgroup analysis, the RR of administration of probiotics for 3 months or less was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.97). The RR of administration of probiotics over 3 months was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.92 to 1.09). The RR of administration of probiotics without any active intervention (vitamin and mineral) was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.97). CONCLUSION: In this meta-analysis, there was marginal effect of probiotics on the prevention of the common cold. The results implied that probiotics had a modest effect in common cold reduction.

To date, few studies have examined the circadian pattern of motor activity in children and adolescents newly diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The objective was to study the circadian pattern of motor activity in subjects with ADHD (medication naive) and to investigate the relationships between alterations in circadian patterns, the ADHD subtype (combined or inattentive), sleep disturbances and body mass index (BMI). One-hundred twenty children and adolescents (60 medication naive ADHD and 60 controls) were included in a gender- and age-matched case-control study. ADHD was diagnosed according to the DSM-IV-TR, the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version, and the Conner's Parents Rating Scale-Revised. Circadian rhythms of motor activity and sleep parameters were measured using actigraphy and the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. BMI and dietary intake were also evaluated. ADHD patients showed a trend towards eveningness and greater sleep disturbances than controls. Additionally, patients with ADHD-combined had significantly higher mean values of motor activity and showed a significant delay in bedtime. Furthermore, among ADHD-C patients hyperactivity symptoms were significantly associated with the least 5 h of activity. Regarding patients with ADHD-inattentive, increased fragmentation of the circadian pattern was associated with inattention symptoms, and they also showed a significant increase in BMI of 2.52 kg/m(2) [95% CI 0.31, 4.73] in comparison with controls.

BACKGROUND: In Sub-Saharan Africa, most nutrition efforts have concentrated on under-nutrition in children. However, national surveys rarely report the high prevalence of overweight and obesity among children. Likewise, in Ethiopia there is growing recognition of the emergence of a ""double-burden"" of malnutrition, with under and over nutrition occurring simultaneously among children, especially allied with improvements in socio-economic conditions. Hence, the study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with overweight and obesity among private kindergarten school children aged 3-6 years in Bahirdar town, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A school-based cross sectional study was conducted in Bahirdar Town, northwest Ethiopia from August to September, 2015. Anthropometric measurements such as weight and height were taken from 462 private Kindergarten preschool children aged 3-6 years; socio-economic and demographic factors and feeding practices were collected by interviewing the, mothers or caregivers of the children. The z-score values for BMI-for-age of children were generated using Emergency Nutrition Assessment (ENA) for Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief Transitions (SMART) 2011. Binary logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with overweight and obesity in children. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated to show the strength of association. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of overweight and obesity was 6.9% [95% CI 2.4, 11.4]. The prevalence of overweight and obesity were 4.1 and 2.8%, respectively. The odds of overweight and obesity was higher among children with high dietary diversity score (DDS) [AOR = 5.12, 95% CI 1.42, 18.47], family size of less than five [AOR = 4.76, 95% CI 1.84, 12.31] and a family having a private car [AOR = 3.43, 95% CI 1.02, 11.49].

BACKGROUND: Sex hormones closely regulate development of the male genital organs during fetal life. The hypothesis that xenobiotics may disrupt endogenous hormonal signalling has received considerable scientific attention, but human evidence is scarce. OBJECTIVES: We analyse occurrence of hypospadias and cryptorchidism according to maternal and paternal occupational exposure to possible endocrine disrupting chemicals. METHODS: We conducted a follow-up study of 45,341 male singleton deliveries in the Danish National Birth Cohort during 1997-2009. Information on work during pregnancy was obtained by telephone interviews around gestational week 16. Parents' job titles were classified according to DISCO-88. A job exposure matrix for endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) was implemented to assess occupational exposures. The Medical Birth and National Hospital Register provided data on congenital anomalies diagnosed at birth or during follow-up, which ended in 2009. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were obtained from Cox regression models. RESULTS: Among all pregnancies, 6.3% were classified as possibly or probably exposed to EDCs. The most prevalent occupations conferring possible exposure were cleaners, laboratory technicians, hairdressers and agricultural workers (58% of all potentially exposed). The final cumulative incidence of cryptorchidism in boys was 2.2% (1002 cases), and of hypospadias 0.6% (262 cases). The occurrence of hypospadias increased when mothers were probably [HRa = 1.8 (95% CI 1.0-2.6)] or possibly exposed to one or more EDCs [HRa = 2.6 (95% CI 1.8-3.4). Possible paternal exposure to heavy metals increased the risk of hypospadias [HRa 2.2 (95% CI: 1.0-3.4)] and cryptorchidism [HRa 1.9 (95% CI: 1.1-2.7)]. None of the exposure groups reached statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The study provides some but limited evidence that occupational exposure to possible endocrine disrupting chemicals during pregnancy increases the risk of hypospadias."

METHODS: We conducted a follow-up study of 45,341 male singleton deliveries in the Danish National Birth Cohort during 1997-2009. Information on work during pregnancy was obtained by telephone interviews around gestational week 16. Parents' job titles were classified according to DISCO-88. A job exposure matrix for endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) was implemented to assess occupational exposures. The Medical Birth and National Hospital Register provided data on congenital anomalies diagnosed at birth or during follow-up, which ended in 2009. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were obtained from Cox regression models. RESULTS: Among all pregnancies, 6.3% were classified as possibly or probably exposed to EDCs. The most prevalent occupations conferring possible exposure were cleaners, laboratory technicians, hairdressers and agricultural workers (58% of all potentially exposed). The final cumulative incidence of cryptorchidism in boys was 2.2% (1002 cases), and of hypospadias 0.6% (262 cases). The occurrence of hypospadias increased when mothers were probably [HRa = 1.8 (95% CI 1.0-2.6)] or possibly exposed to one or more EDCs [HRa = 2.6 (95% CI 1.8-3.4). Possible paternal exposure to heavy metals increased the risk of hypospadias [HRa 2.2 (95% CI: 1.0-3.4)] and cryptorchidism [HRa 1.9 (95% CI: 1.1-2.7)]. None of the exposure groups reached statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The study provides some but limited evidence that occupational exposure to possible endocrine disrupting chemicals during pregnancy increases the risk of hypospadias."

BACKGROUND: Sex hormones closely regulate development of the male genital organs during fetal life.

Objective: To investigate the relationship between shift work and overweight/obesity in male steel workers. Methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted among the male steel workers selected during health examination in Tangshan Steel Company from March 2015 to March 2016. The relationship between shift work and overweight/obesity in the male steel workers were analyzed by using logistic regression model and restricted cubic splinemodel. Results: A total of 7 262 male steel workers were surveyed, the overall prevalence of overweight/obesitywas 64.5% (4 686/7 262), the overweight rate was 34.3% and the obesity rate was 30.2%, respectively. After adjusting for age, educational level and average family income level per month by multivariable logistic regression analysis, shift work was associated with overweight/obesity and obesity in the male steel workers. The OR was 1.19(95% CI: 1.05-1.35) and 1.15(95% CI: 1.00-1.32). Restricted cubic spline model analysis showed that the relationship between shift work years and overweight/obesity in the male steel workers was a nonlinear dose response one (nonlinear test chi(2)=7.43, P<0.05).

sleep disorder	air pollutants	Statistically_associated	29939357	test	T8	T9	997:1011	1046:1060	"Association between long-term exposure to air pollution and sleep disorder in Chinese children: the Seven Northeastern Cities study. 
Study Objectives: There is limited knowledge regarding the effects of air pollution on sleep disorders, particularly in children. The aim of this study is to investigate this association in Chinese children. Methods: During 2012-2013, 59754 children aged 2-17 years were randomly selected from 27 districts in seven northeastern Chinese cities. All participants' sleep was evaluated with the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Four year average concentrations of pollutants were calculated for particles with an aerodynamic diameter of <=1 microm (PM1), <=2.5 microm (PM2.5) from a spatial statistical model, and <=10 microm (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO) from monitoring stations. To examine the effects, two-level regression analysis was used, controlling for covariates. Results: We observed that sleep disorder was generally associated with all air pollutants, with the highest odds among PM1 exposure for male (odds ratio [OR] 1.55; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.36-1.76) and female (OR 1.50; 95% CI 1.30-1.72) children. The overall strongest association with sleep disorder symptom was exposure to PM1 and Disorders of Excessive Somnolence (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.30-1.58). PM1 and PM2.5 were strongly associated with all sleep disorder symptoms in females (ORs ranged for PM1 from 1.19 to 1.49; and PM2.5 1.18 to 1.44).

Study Objectives: There is limited knowledge regarding the effects of air pollution on sleep disorders, particularly in children. The aim of this study is to investigate this association in Chinese children. Methods: During 2012-2013, 59754 children aged 2-17 years were randomly selected from 27 districts in seven northeastern Chinese cities. All participants' sleep was evaluated with the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Four year average concentrations of pollutants were calculated for particles with an aerodynamic diameter of <=1 microm (PM1), <=2.5 microm (PM2.5) from a spatial statistical model, and <=10 microm (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO) from monitoring stations. To examine the effects, two-level regression analysis was used, controlling for covariates. Results: We observed that sleep disorder was generally associated with all air pollutants, with the highest odds among PM1 exposure for male (odds ratio [OR] 1.55; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.36-1.76) and female (OR 1.50; 95% CI 1.30-1.72) children. The overall strongest association with sleep disorder symptom was exposure to PM1 and Disorders of Excessive Somnolence (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.30-1.58). PM1 and PM2.5 were strongly associated with all sleep disorder symptoms in females (ORs ranged for PM1 from 1.19 to 1.49; and PM2.5 1.18 to 1.44).

OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to bring light on fluoride to control dentin hypersensitivity (DHS) and prevent root caries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Search strategy included papers mainly published in PubMed, Medline from October 2000 to October 2011. RESULTS: Fluoride toothpaste shows a fair effect on sensitive teeth when combined with dentin fluid-obstructing agents such as different metal ions, potassium, and oxalates. Fluoride in solution, gel, and varnish give an instant and long-term relief of dentin and bleaching hypersensitivity. Combined with laser technology, a limited additional positive effect is achieved. Prevention of root caries is favored by toothpaste with 5,000 ppm F and by fluoride rinsing with 0.025-0.1 % F solutions, as the application of fluoride gel or fluoride varnish three to four times a year. Fluoride measures with tablets, chewing gum, toothpick, and flossing may be questioned because of unfavorable cost effectiveness ratio. CONCLUSION: Most fluoride preparations in combination with dentin fluid obstruction agents are beneficial to reduce DHS. Prevention of root caries is favorable with higher fluoride concentrations in, e.g., toothpaste. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Fluoride is an effective agent to control DHS and to prevent root caries particularly when used in higher concentrations."

coeliac disease	dietary management	Statistically_associated	27521165	test	T18	T32	1350:1365	1300:1318	"The prevalence and predictors of disordered eating in women with coeliac disease. 
PURPOSE: The need for dietary management in coeliac disease may lead to the development of disordered eating. This study examined the prevalence of disordered eating and factors predicting disordered eating in women with coeliac disease, compared with other dietary-controlled conditions. METHODS: A cross-sectional, online survey assessing psychological well-being, disordered eating behaviours (Eating Attitudes Test 26 (EAT-26); Binge Eating Scale (BES)) was distributed using online forums, to those with coeliac disease (N = 157), inflammatory bowel disease (N = 116), type two diabetes (N = 88) and healthy controls (N = 142). Hierarchical regressions were conducted to explore and compare the predictors of EAT-26 and BES scores across all groups. Within the coeliac disease group, a cluster analysis was conducted to examine types of disordered eating. RESULTS: Higher EAT-26 scores were found in those with coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease compared with healthy controls and type two diabetes; participants with a chronic health condition had higher BES than healthy control participants. The factors associated with EAT-26 scores differed across the dietary-controlled health conditions, with dietary management being important for those with coeliac disease. Psychological distress was associated with binge-eating behaviour across all groups. Cluster analyses found two types of disordered eating in coeliac disease; a binge eating type and a restrictive type. CONCLUSIONS: Disordered eating attitudes and behaviours are more prevalent in participants with chronic health conditions relative to healthy controls. The presence of binge eating behaviours in coeliac disease may be related to non-coeliac disease specific factors such as the distress associated with dietary-controlled illness. EAT-26 scores in coeliac disease are associated with disease specific factors, unique to following the gluten-free diet. These factors are important for identifying and supporting those with coeliac disease and disordered eating."

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of eating disorders (EDs) among university students in a rural area of Turkey and to compare groups based on the sociodemographic data, history of child abuse and neglect, family roles and self-esteem with a normal control group regarding EDs. METHOD: Subjects who were chosen by simple random sampling method were consisted of 980 Cumhuriyet University students who agreed to participate out of the 1003 total students and were given a sociodemographic information form and an Eating Attitudes Test (EAT). Students who scored above a cutoff level on the EAT were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV axis I Disorders (SCID-I), Clinical Version. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Family Assessment Device (FAD) and Childhood Abuse and Neglect Questionnaire Form were given to subjects in the control and study groups. RESULTS: Seventy-one of the 951 students (492 female, 459 male) who correctly filled out the EAT had a score above the cutoff level of 30 or higher. Of these 71 students, 21 (2.20%) were found to have an eating disorder based on the SCID-I. No subjects were found to have anorexia nervosa. Eighteen of the 21 subjects were female. Of these 18 female students, 15 (1.57%) were found to have bulimia nervosa and three (0.31%) were found to have binge eating disorder (BED). All of the three male subjects were diagnosed with BED (0.31%). The self-esteem of those in the study group was lower than those in the control group (p < 0.001). Subjects in the study group had more frequent histories of sexual and emotional abuse in childhood (p < 0.05). Also, in the study group scores showing communication in FAD families, unity and emotional attachment were statistically significantly lower than the control group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: It has been observed from the results of this research that the frequency of bulimia nervosa and BED in this sample is so similar to Western samples. Besides that, self-esteem, child abuse and neglect, and family functions must be examined in detail because they are risk factors for EDs and affect the course of treatment."

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of allergic diseases differs in urban and rural populations. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess associations between environmental and dietary factors with allergic diseases in urban and rural South African children. METHODS: Toddlers aged 12 to 36 months were assessed for food allergen and aeroallergen sensitization, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma, and challenge-proved food allergy. Information was collected on family history of allergic diseases, household size, socioeconomic status, delivery mode, antibiotic and probiotic use, exposure to fermented and unpasteurized milk, antihelminth treatment, sunlight exposure, pet and farm animal exposure, cigarette smoke, and household cooking and heating fuels. Antenatal exposures to pets, livestock, and cigarette smoke were assessed. A subsection completed questions on consumption of fruits and vegetables, fast foods, soft drinks/fruit juices, and fried/microwaved meat. RESULTS: Risk and protective factors differed between urban and rural settings. Exposure to farm animals in infants and their mothers during pregnancy was protective against allergic outcomes in the rural population. Consumption of unpasteurized milk is uncommon in this group of rural children and is unlikely to be an important factor in rural protection. In urban children birth by cesarean section is associated with food allergy, and consumption of fermented milk products is associated with reduced asthma and atopic dermatitis. In both cohorts antenatal maternal smoking and environmental smoking exposure were predominantly associated with asthma, and consumption of fast foods and fried meats were associated with allergy. CONCLUSION: In this rural environment exposure to livestock is the strongest protective factor. In urban communities, where animal contact is rare, risk factors include cesarian section, and protective factors include consumption of fermented milk products. Modifiable risk factors urgently require interventions to prevent increasing allergy rates in countries undergoing rapid urbanization."

Exposure to farm animals in infants and their mothers during pregnancy was protective against allergic outcomes in the rural population. Consumption of unpasteurized milk is uncommon in this group of rural children and is unlikely to be an important factor in rural protection. In urban children birth by cesarean section is associated with food allergy, and consumption of fermented milk products is associated with reduced asthma and atopic dermatitis. In both cohorts antenatal maternal smoking and environmental smoking exposure were predominantly associated with asthma, and consumption of fast foods and fried meats were associated with allergy. CONCLUSION: In this rural environment exposure to livestock is the strongest protective factor. In urban communities, where animal contact is rare, risk factors include cesarian section, and protective factors include consumption of fermented milk products. Modifiable risk factors urgently require interventions to prevent increasing allergy rates in countries undergoing rapid urbanization."

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of allergic diseases differs in urban and rural populations. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess associations between environmental and dietary factors with allergic diseases in urban and rural South African children. METHODS: Toddlers aged 12 to 36 months were assessed for food allergen and aeroallergen sensitization, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma, and challenge-proved food allergy. Information was collected on family history of allergic diseases, household size, socioeconomic status, delivery mode, antibiotic and probiotic use, exposure to fermented and unpasteurized milk, antihelminth treatment, sunlight exposure, pet and farm animal exposure, cigarette smoke, and household cooking and heating fuels. Antenatal exposures to pets, livestock, and cigarette smoke were assessed.

Evidence of social determinants of disease and awareness of the impact of these factors on outcomes continues to increase. Social determinants include both socioeconomic and lifestyle factors. This review examines the interface between socioeconomic status (SES) and lifestyle and their effects on melanoma incidence and mortality. Lifestyle factors including occupation, occupational exposures, body mass index, marital status, smoking, recreational sun exposure and tanning were explored as they have a known relationship with melanoma. A remarkable association of SES with melanoma incidence and prognosis has been acknowledged worldwide. Melanoma incidence is increased in populations of higher SES, especially among the highly educated, while lower SES populations present with later-stage disease at time of diagnosis and display greater mortality. The aforementioned lifestyle factors are also related to SES, and have been shown internationally to affect melanoma incidence and mortality.

melanoma	lifestyle factors	Statistically_associated	25354495	test	T14	T32	1275:1283	1120:1137	"Socioeconomic and lifestyle factors and melanoma: a systematic review. 
Evidence of social determinants of disease and awareness of the impact of these factors on outcomes continues to increase. Social determinants include both socioeconomic and lifestyle factors. This review examines the interface between socioeconomic status (SES) and lifestyle and their effects on melanoma incidence and mortality. Lifestyle factors including occupation, occupational exposures, body mass index, marital status, smoking, recreational sun exposure and tanning were explored as they have a known relationship with melanoma. A remarkable association of SES with melanoma incidence and prognosis has been acknowledged worldwide. Melanoma incidence is increased in populations of higher SES, especially among the highly educated, while lower SES populations present with later-stage disease at time of diagnosis and display greater mortality. The aforementioned lifestyle factors are also related to SES, and have been shown internationally to affect melanoma incidence and mortality. This comprehensive systematic review suggests that lifestyle factors including occupation, occupational exposure, obesity, recreational sun exposure and tanning may explain the relationship between SES and melanoma."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of hypertension among residents in Pengzhou city of Sichuan province. METHODS: Among 20 townships in Pengzhou city of Sichuan Province, 14 townships were selected using a clustered sampling based on the economic level and distance. The registered residents in the selected townships aged 30-79 years were recruited for a comprehensive survey from 2004 to 2007. A total of 55 687 residents (21 315 males and 34 372 females) were selected based on a face to face questionnaire interview and physical examination; the patient group included 14 151 residents with hypertension and the control group had 41 536 residents without hypertension were selected. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to investigate the influence factors for hypertension. OR (95%CI) values were calculated. Different levels of risk exposure factors were transformed into the risk scores using a statistical model. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of hypertension was 25.41% among residents aged 30 years or above in Pengzhou (14 151/55 687), 28.95% (6 170/21 315) for male residents and 23.22% (7 981/34 372) for female residents. Multivaraite logistic regression analysis showed that main risk factors for hypertension in male residents were age, low educational level, widower, low household income, no medical insurance, no fresh fruits intake, high body mass index (BMI), high waist to hip ratio, and low physical activity, which was less than 3 metabolic equivalent of task (MET) level, among which the highest three riskswere (not including the social demographic characteristics) BMI>=28 kg/m(2), waist to hip ratio >=0.90, and not consuming fresh fruits. OR (95% CI) values for these three key factors were 3.74 (3.27-4.28), 1.34 (1.24-1.44), and 1.27 (1.14-1.41), respectively. The corresponding risk scores for these factors were 2.993, 1.102, and 1.237, respectively. Main risk factors for hypertension in female residents were age, working hours, no medical insurance, fewer number of family members, no fresh fruits intake, smoking, never drinking tea, no dairy products intake, high BMI, highwaist to hip ratio and low physical activity, among which the highest three risks were (not including the social demographic characteristics) BMI >=28 kg/m(2), MET level, and waist to hip ratio >=0.85. OR (95% CI) values for these three key factors were 3.30 (3.02-3.60), 1.35 (1.22-1.51), and 1.33 (1.23-1.44), respectively.

METHODS: Among 20 townships in Pengzhou city of Sichuan Province, 14 townships were selected using a clustered sampling based on the economic level and distance. The registered residents in the selected townships aged 30-79 years were recruited for a comprehensive survey from 2004 to 2007. A total of 55 687 residents (21 315 males and 34 372 females) were selected based on a face to face questionnaire interview and physical examination; the patient group included 14 151 residents with hypertension and the control group had 41 536 residents without hypertension were selected. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to investigate the influence factors for hypertension. OR (95%CI) values were calculated. Different levels of risk exposure factors were transformed into the risk scores using a statistical model. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of hypertension was 25.41% among residents aged 30 years or above in Pengzhou (14 151/55 687), 28.95% (6 170/21 315) for male residents and 23.22% (7 981/34 372) for female residents. Multivaraite logistic regression analysis showed that main risk factors for hypertension in male residents were age, low educational level, widower, low household income, no medical insurance, no fresh fruits intake, high body mass index (BMI), high waist to hip ratio, and low physical activity, which was less than 3 metabolic equivalent of task (MET) level, among which the highest three riskswere (not including the social demographic characteristics) BMI>=28 kg/m(2), waist to hip ratio >=0.90, and not consuming fresh fruits. OR (95% CI) values for these three key factors were 3.74 (3.27-4.28), 1.34 (1.24-1.44), and 1.27 (1.14-1.41), respectively. The corresponding risk scores for these factors were 2.993, 1.102, and 1.237, respectively. Main risk factors for hypertension in female residents were age, working hours, no medical insurance, fewer number of family members, no fresh fruits intake, smoking, never drinking tea, no dairy products intake, high BMI, highwaist to hip ratio and low physical activity, among which the highest three risks were (not including the social demographic characteristics) BMI >=28 kg/m(2), MET level, and waist to hip ratio >=0.85. OR (95% CI) values for these three key factors were 3.30 (3.02-3.60), 1.35 (1.22-1.51), and 1.33 (1.23-1.44), respectively. The corresponding risk scores for these factors were 2.390, 1.263, and 1.051, respectively. CONCLUSION: The prevalence rate of hypertension among the residents over 30 years of age in Pengzhou city was 25.41%. The main risk factors were age, not consuming fresh fruits, high BMI, high waist to hip ratio, and low MET level."

breast cancer	night shift	Statistically_associated	22645325	test	T4	T3	197:210	161:172	"Nested case-control study of night shift work and breast cancer risk among women in the Danish military. 
OBJECTIVES: Growing but limited evidence suggests that night shift work is associated with breast cancer. The authors conducted a nationwide case-control study nested within a cohort of 18,551 female military employees born in 1929-1968 to investigate the risk for breast cancer after night shift work and to explore the role of leisure time sun exposure and diurnal preference. METHODS: The authors documented 218 cases of breast cancer (1990-2003) and selected 899 age-matched controls from the cohort by incidence density sampling. Information on shift work, sun exposure habits, diurnal preference and other potential confounders was obtained from a structured questionnaire. ORs were estimated by multivariate conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, the authors observed an adjusted OR of 1.4 (95% CI 0.9 to 2.1) among women with ever compared with never night shifts. The RR for breast cancer tended to increase with increasing number of years of night shift work (p=0.03) and with cumulative number of shifts (p=0.02),with a neutral risk for fewer than three night shifts per week. The OR for the group with the highest tertile of cumulative exposure was 2.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 4.6). The most pronounced effect of night shift work on breast cancer risk was observed in women with morning chronotype preference and intense night shifts (OR=3.9, 95% CI 1.6 to 9.5). Night shift workers tended to sunbathe more frequently than day workers. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that frequent night shift work increases the risk for breast cancer and suggest a higher risk with longer duration of intense night shifts. Women with morning preference who worked on night shifts tended to have a higher risk than those with evening preference."

diarrhoea	hygiene practices	negative_statistical_association	26093582	test	T14	T20	2321:2330	2225:2242	"Current knowledge, attitude and behaviour of hand and food hygiene in a developed residential community of Singapore: a cross-sectional survey. 
BACKGROUND: Diarrhoea incidence has been increasing progressively over the past years in developed countries, including Singapore, despite the accessibility and availability to clean water, well-established sanitation infrastructures and regular hygiene promotion. The aim of this study is to determine the current knowledge, attitude and behaviour of hand and food hygiene, and the potential risk factors of diarrhoea in a residential community of Singapore. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted within a residential area in the west of Singapore from June to August 2013. A total of 1,156 household units were randomly sampled and invited to participate in an interviewer-assisted survey using standardised questionnaires. Descriptive, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using descriptive statistics, Fisher's Exact test and multivariate logistic regression modelling, respectively. R program was used for all statistical analysis. All tests were conducted at 5% level of significance with 95% confidence intervals (CI) reported where applicable. RESULTS: A total of 240 units (20.8%) consented and responded to the survey invitation. About 77% of the expected knowledge and attitude were observed in at least 80% of the participants, compared to only about 31% of the expected behaviours and practises. Being single [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.16-4.48], having flu in the past six month (AOR = 3.24; 95% CI = 1.74-6.06), preferred self-medication (AOR = 2.07; 95% CI = 1.06-4.12) were risk factors of diarrhoea. Washing hands with water before attending to children or sick persons (AOR = 0.30; 95% CI = 0.11-0.82), washing hands with water (AOR = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.05-0.45) and water with soap (AOR = 0.29; 95% CI = 0.12-0.72) after attending to children or sick persons, and hand washing between 30 s to a minute (AOR = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.20-0.90) were protective factors against diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS: Good knowledge and attitude of the participants did not positively translate into high compliance and motivation to perform good hygiene practices. This observation may have resulted in a significant extent on the increasing diarrhoea incidences. Current interventions may be improved with more active community partnership among the residents, schools and the relevant social organizations, to raise awareness on the importance of compliance to good hygiene practices, and the risk factors of diarrhoea. A large case-control study would be required to validate these findings in future."

CONCLUSIONS: Good knowledge and attitude of the participants did not positively translate into high compliance and motivation to perform good hygiene practices. This observation may have resulted in a significant extent on the increasing diarrhoea incidences. Current interventions may be improved with more active community partnership among the residents, schools and the relevant social organizations, to raise awareness on the importance of compliance to good hygiene practices, and the risk factors of diarrhoea. A large case-control study would be required to validate these findings in future."

BACKGROUND: Diarrhoea incidence has been increasing progressively over the past years in developed countries, including Singapore, despite the accessibility and availability to clean water, well-established sanitation infrastructures and regular hygiene promotion. The aim of this study is to determine the current knowledge, attitude and behaviour of hand and food hygiene, and the potential risk factors of diarrhoea in a residential community of Singapore. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted within a residential area in the west of Singapore from June to August 2013. A total of 1,156 household units were randomly sampled and invited to participate in an interviewer-assisted survey using standardised questionnaires. Descriptive, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using descriptive statistics, Fisher's Exact test and multivariate logistic regression modelling, respectively. R program was used for all statistical analysis. All tests were conducted at 5% level of significance with 95% confidence intervals (CI) reported where applicable. RESULTS: A total of 240 units (20.8%) consented and responded to the survey invitation. About 77% of the expected knowledge and attitude were observed in at least 80% of the participants, compared to only about 31% of the expected behaviours and practises.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to estimate the preventable potential of various types of cancer in Denmark on the basis of present knowledge. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The well-documented factors in lifestyle and environment causing cancer in Denmark were identified from the IARC Monograph series. The population attributable risk per cent (PAR%) and the annual number of preventable cancers were calculated for each aetiology and cancer type around the year 2000. RESULTS: A large proportion of the cancers occurring in the lungs, larynx, upper digestive tract, skin, lower urinary tract, and the uterine cervix is potentially avoidable, whereas only a small proportion of breast and colorectal cancers is preventable on the given knowledge. The main causative factors include active and passive smoking, alcohol intake, exposure to asbestos and other occupational carcinogens, solar and ionising radiation, obesity, human papillomavirus infection in the female genital tract, and infection with Helicobacter pylori. More than 5000 cancers in men and almost 3500 in women annually in Denmark could have been avoided by eliminating exposure to these known carcinogens. This is equivalent to 39% and 23% of all cancers occurring respectively in men and women, around the year 2000. Smoking habits account for more than half of these avoidable cases. DISCUSSION: The incidence of cancer could be greatly reduced through primary prevention, especially of tobacco smoking, which is the major single factor. A large proportion of the cancers occurring in the lungs, larynx, upper digestive tract, skin, lower urinary tract, and the uterine cervix are potentially avoidable. More research in the field of aetiological factors causing female breast cancer and colorectal cancer is much needed in order to be able to prevent these types of cancer."

metabolic dysfunctions	phthalates	positive_statistical_association	29680886	test	T14	T5	297:319	264:274	"Phthalates and type 1 diabetes: is there any link? 
Phthalates are a group of chemical compounds used as plasticizers in the manufacture of plastic materials. They can be present in many commonly used products. There seems to be a relationship between exposure to phthalates and the occurrence of metabolic dysfunctions, such as a decrease in glucose tolerance, oxidative stress, loss of beta cells, and a decrease in insulin synthesis. As beta cells play a key role in the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), we sought to investigate the relationship between exposure to phthalates and the diagnosis of T1DM in prepubertal children. Design concentrations of phthalate metabolites were compared in the urine of a population of prepubertal children with new-onset diabetes, patients with T1DM diagnosed more than 6 months previously, and healthy control children. Although the concentrations of DBP and DiBP metabolites were statistically identical in the new-onset diabetes, diabetes, and control groups, there was a clear trend for higher levels of DiBP metabolites in the children with new-onset diabetes. In our sample, there was a trend for higher levels of DiBP metabolites in children with new-onset diabetes."

BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers are sharing their challenges, including sleep disturbances, on social media; however, no study has evaluated sleep in predominantly US frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess sleep among a sample of predominantly US frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic using validated measures through a survey distributed on social media. METHODS: A self-selection survey was distributed on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for 16 days (August 31 to September 15, 2020), targeting health care workers who were clinically active during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and they reported their demographic and career information. Poor sleep quality was defined as a PSQI score >=5. Moderate-to-severe insomnia was defined as an ISI score >14. The Mini-Z Burnout Survey was used to measure burnout. Multivariate logistic regression tested associations between demographics, career characteristics, and sleep outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 963 surveys were completed. Participants were predominantly White (894/963, 92.8%), female (707/963, 73.4%), aged 30-49 years (692/963, 71.9%), and physicians (620/963, 64.4%). Mean sleep duration was 6.1 hours (SD 1.2). Nearly 96% (920/963, 95.5%) of participants reported poor sleep (PSQI). One-third (288/963, 30%) reported moderate or severe insomnia. Many participants (554/910, 60.9%) experienced sleep disruptions due to device use or had nightmares at least once per week (420/929, 45.2%). Over 50% (525/932, 56.3%) reported burnout. In multivariable logistic regressions, nonphysician (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, 95% CI 1.7-3.4), caring for patients with COVID-19 (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.8), Hispanic ethnicity (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.5), female sex (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4), and having a sleep disorder (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.7-6.9) were associated with increased odds of insomnia. In open-ended comments (n=310), poor sleep was mapped to four categories: children and family, work demands, personal health, and pandemic-related sleep disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all the frontline health care workers surveyed on social media reported poor sleep, over one-third reported insomnia, and over half reported burnout. Many also reported sleep disruptions due to device use and nightmares. Sleep interventions for frontline health care workers are urgently needed."

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess sleep among a sample of predominantly US frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic using validated measures through a survey distributed on social media. METHODS: A self-selection survey was distributed on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for 16 days (August 31 to September 15, 2020), targeting health care workers who were clinically active during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and they reported their demographic and career information. Poor sleep quality was defined as a PSQI score >=5. Moderate-to-severe insomnia was defined as an ISI score >14. The Mini-Z Burnout Survey was used to measure burnout. Multivariate logistic regression tested associations between demographics, career characteristics, and sleep outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 963 surveys were completed. Participants were predominantly White (894/963, 92.8%), female (707/963, 73.4%), aged 30-49 years (692/963, 71.9%), and physicians (620/963, 64.4%). Mean sleep duration was 6.1 hours (SD 1.2). Nearly 96% (920/963, 95.5%) of participants reported poor sleep (PSQI). One-third (288/963, 30%) reported moderate or severe insomnia. Many participants (554/910, 60.9%) experienced sleep disruptions due to device use or had nightmares at least once per week (420/929, 45.2%). Over 50% (525/932, 56.3%) reported burnout. In multivariable logistic regressions, nonphysician (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, 95% CI 1.7-3.4), caring for patients with COVID-19 (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.8), Hispanic ethnicity (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.5), female sex (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4), and having a sleep disorder (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.7-6.9) were associated with increased odds of insomnia. In open-ended comments (n=310), poor sleep was mapped to four categories: children and family, work demands, personal health, and pandemic-related sleep disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all the frontline health care workers surveyed on social media reported poor sleep, over one-third reported insomnia, and over half reported burnout. Many also reported sleep disruptions due to device use and nightmares. Sleep interventions for frontline health care workers are urgently needed."

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death, and its mortality is increasing in Latin America. However, population-based data on cardiovascular disease risk factors are sparse in these countries. METHODS: A total of 7524 men and women, aged 35 to 74 years old, were recruited between February 2010 and December 2011 from randomly selected samples in 4 cities (Bariloche and Marcos Paz, Argentina; Temuco, Chile; and Pando-Barros Blancos, Uruguay) in the Southern Cone of Latin America. Cardiovascular risk factors were measured using standard methods by trained and certified observers. RESULTS: Approximately 85.5% of adults ate less than five servings of fruit or vegetables per day, 35.2% engaged in low physical activity, and 29.7% currently smoked cigarettes. The prevalences of obesity, central obesity, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome were 35.7%, 52.9%, 40.8%, 2.0%, 58.4%, 12.4%, and 37.4%, respectively. The proportion of individuals with >=3 cardiovascular risk factors, including low intake of fruit and vegetables, low physical activity, current cigarette smoking, obesity or central obesity, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, was 68.3%, and the proportion of individuals with >=3 cardiometabolic risk factors, including obesity or central obesity, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, was 22.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular disease risk factors are highly prevalent in the general population in the Southern Cone of Latin America. These data suggest that national efforts on the prevention, treatment, and control of cardiovascular risk factors should be a public health priority in the Southern Cone of Latin America."

Exposure to viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens is unavoidable. Yet, the mere presence of these threats is not enough to automatically predispose to illness. The susceptibility of an individual to viral or bacterial infections is dependent upon immune competence. Many factors can interfere with the functioning of the immune system. Epigenetic alterations in the form of lifestyle or environmental factors can lead to impaired immunity. For example, exposure to air pollution can increase the risk of complications and mortality from COVID-19. Obesity can also exacerbate the damaging effects of air pollution on the lungs and may enhance the association between air pollution and increased COVID-19 severity. Poor sleep is another factor leading to impaired immunity, likely due to the coinciding melatonin depletion. Melatonin has been found to have antiviral and immune-enhancing effects, and it has been proposed that this hormone may be beneficial in COVID-19 patients. Zinc and vitamins D and C have also been well studied for their ability to shorten the duration of upper respiratory infections, and vitamin D has been found to reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients. Cannabidiol can both directly and indirectly improve immunity by enhancing natural killer cell activity, reducing inflammation, and relieving stress. Other dietary supplements backed by solid scientific evidence to show they act as immune enhancers are astragalus, a yeast fermentate (EpiCor(R)), olive leaf extract, berberine, N-acetyl cysteine, and garlic."

OBJECTIVE: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) may cause functional impairment and reduced time engaged in physical activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the habits of patients with JIA regarding participation in club sports, leisure-time physical activity, and school-educational physical activity and relate this to objectively measured physical activity using accelerometry and to compare the findings with those in healthy controls. METHODS: Consecutive patients from the Aarhus University Hospital outpatient clinic were included. Clinical characteristics, functional ability, and exploration of specific habits in club sports, leisure-time physical activity, and school-educational physical activity (based on a standardized questionnaire) in patients were recorded and compared with those in healthy controls. The intensity and frequency of physical activity were measured by accelerometer monitoring, using ActiGraph GT1M. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients with JIA and 118 healthy control subjects were included. Despite having low disease activity, children with JIA had significantly lower accelerometry-monitored physical activity levels compared with healthy controls. The distribution of specific club sport activities was the same among patients and controls. However, the proportion of patients spending >3 hours/week participating in club sports was significantly lower than the proportion of controls, whereas no difference in time spent engaging in physical activity during leisure-time was observed. Participation in compulsory school-educational physical activity was equally high in patients and controls, although participation by patients was significantly less consistent than that by controls. Patient reports of time spent with club sport and leisure-time physical activity was significantly related to accelerometry measures, whereas this was not observed for school-educational physical activity. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate the need for structured guidance for all patients with JIA (including those with minimal disease activity) in both understanding and coping with the consequences of a low level of physical activity."

obesity	high fat diet	Causes	21410952	test	T8	T16	388:395	366:379	"Inflammatory Signals shift from adipose to liver during high fat feeding and influence the development of steatohepatitis in mice. 
BACKGROUND: Obesity and inflammation are highly integrated processes in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Molecular mechanisms underlying inflammatory events during high fat diet-induced obesity are poorly defined in mouse models of obesity. This work investigated gene activation signals integral to the temporal development of obesity. METHODS: Gene expression analysis in multiple organs from obese mice was done with Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA) using a panel of 92 genes representing cell markers, cytokines, chemokines, metabolic, and activation genes. Mice were monitored for systemic changes characteristic of the disease, including hyperinsulinemia, body weight, and liver enzymes. Liver steatosis and fibrosis as well as cellular infiltrates in liver and adipose tissues were analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Obese C57BL/6 mice were fed with high fat and cholesterol diet (HFC) for 6, 16 and 26 weeks. Here we report that the mRNA levels of macrophage and inflammation associated genes were strongly upregulated at different time points in adipose tissues (6-16 weeks) and liver (16-26 weeks), after the start of HFC feeding. CD11b+ and CD11c+ macrophages highly infiltrated HFC liver at 16 and 26 weeks. We found clear evidence that signals for IL-1beta, IL1RN, TNF-alpha and TGFbeta-1 are present in both adipose and liver tissues and that these are linked to the development of inflammation and insulin resistance in the HFC-fed mice. CONCLUSIONS: Macrophage infiltration accompanied by severe inflammation and metabolic changes occurred in both adipose and liver tissues with a temporal shift in these signals depending upon the duration of HFC feeding. The evidences of gene expression profile, elevated serum alanine aminotransferase, and histological data support a progression towards nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis in these HFC-fed mice within the time frame of 26 weeks."
steatohepatitis	high fat	Statistically_associated	21410952	test	T22	T1	106:121	56:64	"Inflammatory Signals shift from adipose to liver during high fat feeding and influence the development of steatohepatitis in mice. 
BACKGROUND: Obesity and inflammation are highly integrated processes in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Molecular mechanisms underlying inflammatory events during high fat diet-induced obesity are poorly defined in mouse models of obesity. This work investigated gene activation signals integral to the temporal development of obesity. METHODS: Gene expression analysis in multiple organs from obese mice was done with Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA) using a panel of 92 genes representing cell markers, cytokines, chemokines, metabolic, and activation genes. Mice were monitored for systemic changes characteristic of the disease, including hyperinsulinemia, body weight, and liver enzymes. Liver steatosis and fibrosis as well as cellular infiltrates in liver and adipose tissues were analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Obese C57BL/6 mice were fed with high fat and cholesterol diet (HFC) for 6, 16 and 26 weeks. Here we report that the mRNA levels of macrophage and inflammation associated genes were strongly upregulated at different time points in adipose tissues (6-16 weeks) and liver (16-26 weeks), after the start of HFC feeding. CD11b+ and CD11c+ macrophages highly infiltrated HFC liver at 16 and 26 weeks.

Uterine perforation	IUD	Causes	33555216	test	T13	T5	186:205	254:257	"Dislocated intrauterine devices: clinical presentations, diagnosis and management. 
OBJECTIVE: Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are globally one of the most popular methods of contraception. Uterine perforation is one of the most significant complications of IUD use and commonly occurs at the time of IUD insertion rather than presenting as delayed migration. This paper reports a series of 13 cases of displaced IUDs requiring retrieval by laparoscopy or laparotomy. All the IUDs were copper bearing and most perforations occurred immediately after IUD insertion. CASES: In two patients with sigmoid colon injury and IUD penetration of the appendix, laparoscopic management had failed and laparotomy was necessary owing to severe obliteration of the pelvic cavity. In one patient laparotomy was the preferred surgical approach owing to acute bowel perforation. In the remaining patients, the displaced devices were successfully removed by laparoscopy. CONCLUSION: Uterine perforation and IUD migration to the organs in the abdominopelvic cavity are serious complications of IUD insertion and can be successfully managed by laparoscopy, or by laparotomy in the presence of severe pelvic adhesions or unexpected complications."

BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic status (SES)-education, income level, and occupation-is associated with cardiovascular risk. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the association between SES and subclinical atherosclerosis and the potential mechanisms involved. METHODS: SES, lifestyle habits (smoking, dietary patterns, physical activity, and hours of sleep), traditional risk factors, and subclinical atherosclerosis extent were prospectively assessed in 4,025 individuals aged 40 to 54 years without known cardiovascular disease enrolled in the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study. After factors associated with atherosclerosis were identified, a multiple mediation model was created to quantify the effect of SES on subclinical atherosclerosis as explained by lifestyle behaviors. RESULTS: Although education level was significantly associated with the presence of atherosclerosis, no differences were found according to income level in this population. Participants with lower education presented with a higher risk of generalized atherosclerosis than those with higher education (odds ratio: 1.46; 95% confidence interval: 1.15 to 1.85; p = 0.002). Lifestyle behaviors associated with both education level and atherosclerosis extent were: smoking status, number of cigarettes/day, and dietary pattern, which explained 70.5% of the effect of SES on atherosclerosis. Of these, tobacco habit (smoking status 35% and number of cigarettes/day 32%) accounted for most of the explained differences between groups, whereas dietary pattern did not remain a significant mediator in the multiple mediation model. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relative economic homogeneity of the cohort, lower education level is associated with increased subclinical atherosclerosis, mainly mediated by the higher and more frequent tobacco consumption. Smoking cessation programs are still needed, particularly in populations with lower education level."

BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic status (SES)-education, income level, and occupation-is associated with cardiovascular risk. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the association between SES and subclinical atherosclerosis and the potential mechanisms involved. METHODS: SES, lifestyle habits (smoking, dietary patterns, physical activity, and hours of sleep), traditional risk factors, and subclinical atherosclerosis extent were prospectively assessed in 4,025 individuals aged 40 to 54 years without known cardiovascular disease enrolled in the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study. After factors associated with atherosclerosis were identified, a multiple mediation model was created to quantify the effect of SES on subclinical atherosclerosis as explained by lifestyle behaviors. RESULTS: Although education level was significantly associated with the presence of atherosclerosis, no differences were found according to income level in this population. Participants with lower education presented with a higher risk of generalized atherosclerosis than those with higher education (odds ratio: 1.46; 95% confidence interval: 1.15 to 1.85; p = 0.002). Lifestyle behaviors associated with both education level and atherosclerosis extent were: smoking status, number of cigarettes/day, and dietary pattern, which explained 70.5% of the effect of SES on atherosclerosis. Of these, tobacco habit (smoking status 35% and number of cigarettes/day 32%) accounted for most of the explained differences between groups, whereas dietary pattern did not remain a significant mediator in the multiple mediation model. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relative economic homogeneity of the cohort, lower education level is associated with increased subclinical atherosclerosis, mainly mediated by the higher and more frequent tobacco consumption.

OBJECTIVE: Despite scientific evidence of effectiveness, psychotherapy for personality disorders is not yet fully deployed, nor is its reimbursement self-evident. Both clinicians and health care policy-makers increasingly rely on evidence-based medicine and health economics when determining a treatment of choice and reimbursement. This article aims to contribute to that understanding by applying these criteria on psychotherapy as a treatment for patients with personality disorder. METHOD: We have evaluated the available empirical evidence on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, and integrated this with necessity of treatment as a moderating factor. RESULTS: The effectiveness of psychotherapy for personality disorders is well documented with favourable randomized trial results, 2 metaanalyses, and a Cochrane review. However, the evidence does not yet fully live up to modern standards of evidence-based medicine and is mostly limited to borderline and avoidant personality disorders. Data on cost-effectiveness suggest that psychotherapy for personality disorders may lead to cost-savings. However, state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness data are still scarce. An encouraging factor is that the available studies indicate that patients with personality disorder experience a high burden of disease, stressing the necessity of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: When applying an integrated vision on outcome, psychotherapy can be considered not only an effective treatment for patients with personality disorder but also most likely a cost-effective and necessary intervention. However, more state-of-the-art research is required before clinicians and health care policy-makers can fully appreciate the benefits of psychotherapy for personality disorders. Considerable progress is possible if researchers focus their efforts on evidence-based medicine and cost-effectiveness research."

It is critical that the sports physician recognises common and uncommon skin disorders of the athlete. Knowledge of the treatment and prevention of various sports-related dermatoses results in prompt and appropriate care of the athlete. Infections probably cause the most disruption to individual and team activities. Herpes gladiatorum, tinea corporis gladiatorum, impetigo, and furunculosis are sometimes found in epidemic proportions in athletes.

Fortunately, several recent studies suggest that pharmacotherapeutic prevention may be effective for some of these sports-related infections. Inflammatory cutaneous conditions may be banal or potentially life threatening as in the case of exercise-induced anaphylaxis. Athletes who develop exercise-induced anaphylaxis may prevent outbreaks by avoiding food before exercise and extreme temperatures while they exercise. Almost all sports enthusiasts are at risk of developing traumatic entities such as nail dystrophies, calluses and blisters.

The most common injuries afflicting the athlete affect the skin. The list of sports-related dermatoses is vast and includes infections, inflammatory conditions, traumatic entities, environmental encounters, and neoplasms. It is critical that the sports physician recognises common and uncommon skin disorders of the athlete. Knowledge of the treatment and prevention of various sports-related dermatoses results in prompt and appropriate care of the athlete. Infections probably cause the most disruption to individual and team activities. Herpes gladiatorum, tinea corporis gladiatorum, impetigo, and furunculosis are sometimes found in epidemic proportions in athletes. Vigilant surveillance and early treatment help teams avoid these epidemics. Fortunately, several recent studies suggest that pharmacotherapeutic prevention may be effective for some of these sports-related infections. Inflammatory cutaneous conditions may be banal or potentially life threatening as in the case of exercise-induced anaphylaxis. Athletes who develop exercise-induced anaphylaxis may prevent outbreaks by avoiding food before exercise and extreme temperatures while they exercise. Almost all sports enthusiasts are at risk of developing traumatic entities such as nail dystrophies, calluses and blisters. Other more unusual traumatic skin conditions, such as talon noire, jogger's nipples and mogul's palm, occur in specific sports. Several techniques and special clothing exist to help prevent traumatic skin conditions in athletes. Almost all athletes, to some degree, interact with the environment. Winter sport athletes may develop frostbite and swimmers in both fresh and saltwater may develop swimmer's itch or seabather's eruption, respectively. Swimmers with fair skin and light hair may also present with unusual green hair that results from the deposition of copper within the hair.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the role of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)  pandemic in improving personal hygiene in Saudi Arabia. Methods: We administered a questionnaire distributed online between 19 and 28 May 2020 to determine alterations in personal hygiene practices during this pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic phase. Results: We included 211 respondents from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in this study.  Improvement at different levels was detected in all examined personal hygiene items compared to the pre-pandemic stage. The percentages of respondents who always washed their hands after coming back home (34.1%), used soap to wash their hands (58.8%), used a hand sanitizer outside (5.2%), wore a face masks while outside (1.4%) and washed their hands before preparing and/or eating food (74.9%) was increased before the pandemic to 89.6%, 90%, 63.5%, 59.2% and 89.1% during the pandemic, respectively. The percentage of respondents who never shake hands with people they know increased from 0% before the pandemic to 62.6% during the pandemic. The mean duration of washing hands with soap significantly increased from 13.31 seconds before the pandemic to 28.01 seconds during the pandemic (p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a noticeable improvement in the personal hygiene habits in Saudi Arabia mainly those related to COVID-19 prevention."

Marijuana is one of the most abused substances in the world. Marijuana is getting legalized around the world. So, it is crucial to understand its effect on our mental health. Its impact on the schizophrenia spectrum needs our special attention. Even though marijuana has been around for a long time, its exact effects are still unknown. Schizophrenia is a chronic illness affecting approximately 20 million people worldwide. Schizophrenia and cannabis seem to have a close relationship, and we want to explore this. We want to know if marijuana is causing, exacerbating, or treating schizophrenia. This systematic review explores this question. We searched online resources like PubMed, PubMed Central, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar for systematic reviews, traditional reviews, randomized controlled trials, and meta-analysis on cannabis and schizophrenia/ psychosis. We included human studies published in peer-reviewed journals in the English language in the last five years. After reviewing 96 initial results of our search, we excluded 25 duplicates, 29 abstracts, and 18 irrelevant articles. We did a quality assessment for the remaining 24 studies using various quality assessment tools. After the quality assessment, we found 12 articles were of low quality and excluded those. We included the remaining 12 final studies in our systematic review. Out of these 12 studies, five were traditional reviews, two systematic reviews, two meta-analysis, and three observational studies. Six of the articles were on cannabis's effect on just schizophrenia or psychotic disorder. The other six included schizophrenia plus other psychiatric or neurological illnesses. Ten of the studies had data supporting the causative link between cannabis and schizophrenia. Eight records had data supporting the exacerbating effect of marijuana. Six studies had data supporting the therapeutic effect of the cannabidiol (CBD) component of cannabis. From the current data, we can conclude that the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) component of cannabis can be the main culprit causing psychosis and schizophrenia in the at-risk population. THC can also be the one exacerbating symptoms and causing an adverse prognosis in already diagnosed patients. Even though CBD shows therapeutic effects and THC opposing effects, the data is minimal and low safety and efficacy warrants more research. The relation between cannabis and schizophrenia needs further investigation. We need more case-control studies and clinical trials with a larger population to get conclusive data."

INTRODUCTION: The association of malnutrition in the morbidly obese cohort has led to recommendations for preoperative screening before total joint arthroplasty (TJA). However, despite the connection between diabetes and poor nutrition, preoperative screening in the diabetic cohort has not been closely examined. This study compared malnutrition risk between diabetic patients and morbidly obese patients undergoing TJA and investigated the association of malnutrition on 30-day postoperative TJA outcomes in the diabetic cohort. METHODS: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried, and primary TJA patients were identified for inclusion. Patients were stratified by body mass index and diabetes, and outcomes were reported as two composite groups: complications and infections in the 30-day postoperative period. Univariate and multivariate regressions were used for the analysis. RESULTS: Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) were at a high risk of being malnourished in both the morbidly obese and nonmorbidly obese populations (frequencies of 11.9% and 9.9%, respectively). Patients with IDDM, but without morbid obesity, were 1.5x more often malnourished than morbidly obese patients without diabetes mellitus (9.9% versus 6.4%, respectively, P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis among patients with co-occurring diabetes and malnutrition, patients with IDDM were at greatest risk for postoperative complications and infection (odds ratio 2.081 [1.652, 2.621]; P < 0.001 and odds ratio 1.894 [1.231, 2.913]; P = 0.004, respectively). DISCUSSION: Patients with IDDM are at high risk for malnutrition, and increased vigilance should be maintained in this cohort before TJA to optimize outcomes. Future studies should further investigate the utility of preoperative malnutrition screening in this cohort."

BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to examine correlates of sleep and assess its associations with weight status and related behaviors. METHODS: Data were collected in 2015-2017 for 3298 children aged 6-17 years and their parents in 5 Chinese mega-cities. One thousand six hundred and ninety-one children with measured weight, height, and waist circumference in >=2 surveys were included for longitudinal data analyses. Sleep and behaviors were self-reported. RESULTS: Cross-sectional data analyses found that older (beta = -0.29, 95% CI: -0.32, -0.27) and secondary school children (beta = -1.22, 95% CI: -1.31, -1.13) reported shorter sleep than their counterparts. Children with >=college-educated (vs <college) fathers (beta = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.31) or mothers (beta = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.29) reported longer sleep. Longer sleep was longitudinally associated with less sugar-sweetened beverage intake (beta = -0.12 days/h sleep, 95% CI: -0.20, -0.03), more healthy snacks intake (beta = 0.13 days/h sleep, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.25) and having breakfast (beta = 0.07 days/h sleep, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.11), and shorter total screen time (beta = -0.22 h/h sleep, 95% CI: -0.65, -0.21) and surfing the internet/computer time (beta = -0.06 h/h sleep, 95% CI: -0.09, -0.04) among all children. Longer sleep reduced the risk of central obesity (OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.85) for girls. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep among urban Chinese children varies by demographic factors. Longer sleep is associated with healthier weight-related behaviors and lower central obesity risk. IMPACT: Longer sleep was observed in younger, primary school children and children with college-educated parents. Longer sleep increased healthier weight-related behaviors and reduced general and central obesity risk. Provides data on the correlates of sleep duration of children. Gives insights on longitudinal relationships of sleep duration with weight-related behaviors and obesity risk. Findings help inform sleep interventions to increase sleep duration to prevent childhood obesity and unhealthy weight-related behaviors in urban settings of developing countries."

Longer sleep was longitudinally associated with less sugar-sweetened beverage intake (beta = -0.12 days/h sleep, 95% CI: -0.20, -0.03), more healthy snacks intake (beta = 0.13 days/h sleep, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.25) and having breakfast (beta = 0.07 days/h sleep, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.11), and shorter total screen time (beta = -0.22 h/h sleep, 95% CI: -0.65, -0.21) and surfing the internet/computer time (beta = -0.06 h/h sleep, 95% CI: -0.09, -0.04) among all children. Longer sleep reduced the risk of central obesity (OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.85) for girls. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep among urban Chinese children varies by demographic factors. Longer sleep is associated with healthier weight-related behaviors and lower central obesity risk. IMPACT: Longer sleep was observed in younger, primary school children and children with college-educated parents. Longer sleep increased healthier weight-related behaviors and reduced general and central obesity risk. Provides data on the correlates of sleep duration of children. Gives insights on longitudinal relationships of sleep duration with weight-related behaviors and obesity risk. Findings help inform sleep interventions to increase sleep duration to prevent childhood obesity and unhealthy weight-related behaviors in urban settings of developing countries."

Although psychotherapy and antidepressant medication are efficacious in the treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders, it is not known whether they are equally efficacious for all types of disorders, and whether all types of psychotherapy and antidepressants are equally efficacious for each disorder. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies in which psychotherapy and antidepressant medication were directly compared in the treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders. Systematic searches in bibliographical databases resulted in 67 randomized trials, including 5,993 patients that met inclusion criteria, 40 studies focusing on depressive disorders and 27 focusing on anxiety disorders. The overall effect size indicating the difference between psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy after treatment in all disorders was g=0.02 (95% CI: -0.07 to 0.10), which was not statistically significant. Pharmacotherapy was significantly more efficacious than psychotherapy in dysthymia (g=0.30), and psychotherapy was significantly more efficacious than pharmacotherapy in obsessive-compulsive disorder (g=0.64). Furthermore, pharmacotherapy was significantly more efficacious than non-directive counseling (g=0.33), and psychotherapy was significantly more efficacious than pharmacotherapy with tricyclic antidepressants (g=0.21). These results remained significant when we controlled for other characteristics of the studies in multivariate meta-regression analysis, except for the differential effects in dysthymia, which were no longer statistically significant."

coronary heart disease	cigarettes	positive_statistical_association	1864491	test	T8	T9	774:796	844:854	"Hyperinsulinaemia as a predictor of coronary heart disease mortality in a healthy population: the Paris Prospective Study, 15-year follow-up. 
The Paris Prospective Study is a long-term, large-scale study of the factors predicting coronary heart disease. The first follow-up examination included, for subjects not known as having diabetes mellitus, a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test with measurement of plasma insulin and glucose levels, fasting and 2 h post-load. Between 1968 and 1973, 6903 men aged 43-54 years were thus examined. Causes of death were ascertained within this group after 15 years of mean follow-up. The baseline variables were tested as predictors of death from coronary heart disease by a Cox regression analysis. Significant independent predictors of coronary heart disease death were: systolic blood pressure, number of cigarettes per day, plasma cholesterol level, and 2 h post-load plasma insulin level when entered as a categorical variable (below or above 452 pmol/l. i.e. the lower limit of the fifth quintile of the distribution). This dichotomization was performed to account for the non-linear univariate distribution of deaths with increasing post-load insulin values. Fasting plasma insulin level was not an independent predictor of death by coronary heart disease over this long-term follow-up. Levels of blood glucose were not significant independent predictors of death by coronary heart disease when plasma insulin levels were included in the model. The same applied to abnormalities of glucose tolerance when the 125 men with known non-insulin-treated diabetes at baseline were added to the group. Under the assumption that hyperinsulinaemia is a marker of insulin resistance, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that insulin resistance is associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease mortality. However, it is doubtful that circulating insulin per se is a direct cause of arterial complications."

Eating disorders (EDs) and substance use disorders (SUDs) commonly co-occur, especially in conjunction with affective syndromes, yet little is known about opiate abuse and ED symptoms in patients on naltrexone-bupropion therapy. Moreover, evidence suggests that the opioid system can also be regarded as one of the major systems regulating the anticipatory processes preceding binge eating episodes. The lack of evidence in the effectiveness of psychotherapy treatment in addition to psychotropic mediations compounds the difficulties in stabilizing individuals with EDs. This article aims to exhaustively review literature relating to the use of opioid antagonists in the management of binge eating disorder (BED) and other abnormal eating habits and how this can be augmented by the use of psychological approaches to come up with the most effective therapy or combination of therapies to manage these conditions. Although this approach is promising, it has not been evaluated. A review of the literature pertaining to the use of naltrexone in patients with EDs was performed through PubMed, PsycINFO and MEDLINE. We selected 63 relevant articles published between 1981 and 2018 and those written in English. Search terms included ""Opioid antagonists"", ""naltrexone"", ""bupropion"" and ""Psychotherapy"" each combined with ""Binge Eating Disorder"", ""Bulimia Nervosa"", ""Anorexia Nervosa"", ""Eating Disorder"", ""EDNOS"" and ""Obesity"". While working with these articles, we also identified several problems related to use of these methods in real clinical practice. Seventy-seven articles were reviewed, and 63 were selected for inclusion. Data obtained from these sources confirmed that the blockade of opioid receptors diminishes food intake. More recent findings also indicate that the combination of bupropion and naltrexone can induce weight loss. Augmentation of this by introducing psychotherapy may lead to better outcomes. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was the most frequently recommended psychotherapy intervention, showing efficacy for EDs and chemical addictions as documented by most of the studies, but with uncertain efficacy when utilized as augmentation strategy. There are limited data supporting the use of psychotherapy in augmentation of standard therapy in ED; however, there is evidence to support that psychotherapy is safe in this population and has been effective in cases of patients with opiate addiction with and without psychiatric comorbidities as well as BED. More research is needed to establish treatment guidelines. Combining pharmacotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic interventions leads to the achievement of a better outcome in managing patients with EDs. Involving families or the use of support groups increases chances of adherence to the prescribed interventions resulting in higher rates of remission. However, it is clear that all of these interventions must occur in the context of a comprehensive treatment program. We believe that patient-specific psychotherapy may not only facilitate the treatment process, but also cause significant alterations in eating pattern. This approach for BED may lead to more significant treatment outcomes, but this possibility must be tested in larger samples."

Efficacious adherence to treatment protocol predicts metabolic control among Type 2 diabetics (T2DM) [1-4]; however, few healthcare systems employ individualized strategies to mediate the comorbidity of T2DM with other chronic disease states. A clinically prescribed ketogenic diet, patient-centered nutritional education and high intensity interval training (HIIT), girded by solution-focused psychotherapy, modulate significant improvements in the clinical biomarkers associated with concurring T2DM and clinical depression [5-15]. Relevant metabolic change was noted in the following measures: HOMA-IR, triglyceride/HDL ratio, HgA1c, fasting insulin, fasting glucose, fasting triglycerides, LDL, VLDL, HDL, total cholesterol and C-reactive protein. The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) along with clinical interview and the mental status exam showed notable change in the patient's depressive symptoms; likewise, her self-efficacy score normalized, as measured by the General Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (GSE) and the Metabolic Syndrome Compliance Questionnaire (MSC). The case study highlights a 65-year old female who presented with a 26-year history of dually-diagnosed Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and major depressive disorder (MDD).

Intervention goals included improved insulin sensitivity evaluated by the HOMA-IR, sustained glycemic control measured via HgA1c, reduced cardiovascular risk via the triglyceride/HDL ratio, and improved depressive symptoms with increased self-efficacy monitored by the PHQ-9 and GSE/MSC. The results of the 12-week intervention were statistically significant. The patient's HgA1c dropped out of diabetic range (8.0%) and normalized at 5.4%.

A clinically prescribed ketogenic diet, patient-centered nutritional education and high intensity interval training (HIIT), girded by solution-focused psychotherapy, modulate significant improvements in the clinical biomarkers associated with concurring T2DM and clinical depression [5-15]. Relevant metabolic change was noted in the following measures: HOMA-IR, triglyceride/HDL ratio, HgA1c, fasting insulin, fasting glucose, fasting triglycerides, LDL, VLDL, HDL, total cholesterol and C-reactive protein. The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) along with clinical interview and the mental status exam showed notable change in the patient's depressive symptoms; likewise, her self-efficacy score normalized, as measured by the General Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (GSE) and the Metabolic Syndrome Compliance Questionnaire (MSC). The case study highlights a 65-year old female who presented with a 26-year history of dually-diagnosed Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and major depressive disorder (MDD). The patient was prescribed a ketogenic diet (KD), clinically formulated from her resting metabolic rate, body fat percentage and lean body mass, together with weekly nutrition education, high intensity interval training (matched to her cardiovascular conditioning), and eight 45-minute solution-focused psychotherapy sessions. Intervention goals included improved insulin sensitivity evaluated by the HOMA-IR, sustained glycemic control measured via HgA1c, reduced cardiovascular risk via the triglyceride/HDL ratio, and improved depressive symptoms with increased self-efficacy monitored by the PHQ-9 and GSE/MSC. The results of the 12-week intervention were statistically significant. The patient's HgA1c dropped out of diabetic range (8.0%) and normalized at 5.4%. Her average daily glucose measurements declined from 216 mg/dL to 96 mg/dL; the HOMA-IR and triglyceride/HDL ratios improved by 75%. Her marker for clinical depression and measurement of self-efficacy normalized. The 12-week individualized treatment intervention served to functionally reverse 26 years of T2DM, ameliorate two and half decades of chronic depressive disorder and empower/equip the patient with a new experience of hope and success."

atherosclerosis	LTPA	Prevents	24645564	test	T14	T13	1928:1943	1887:1891	"[Long term regular physical activity as a factor modifying the incidence of subclinical atherosclerosis in occupationally active men]. 
BACKGROUND: Optimal dose of physical activity in the prevention of atherosclerosis remains unclear. The purpose of the study was to investigate the influence of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) on selected indices of atherosclerosis in the working-age population of men. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out in a cohort of asymptomatic men participating in follow-up examinations in the Healthy Men Clinic, Medical University of Lodz. Of the 132 men who responded to the invitation to participate in this study, 101 men were eligible for the non-invasive assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis indices. Self-reported PA was assessed by interviewer-administered validated questionnaires. During the latest follow-up subclinical atherosclerosis was measured by assessing the coronary artery calcification (CAC), the carotid inti ma-media thickness (IMT) and the reactive hyperemia index (RHI) using peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT2000). RESULTS: Preliminary results have been elaborated in the group of 60 men (mean age: 61.3 +/- 8.85 years). The participants were predominantly white collar workers with low occupational LTPA. The cohort was divided into 3 groups according to the LTPA level. Both dose and energy expenditure of recreational PA significantly correlated with CA, IMT and RHI in the whole cohort. The majority of men maintained their baseline PA throughout the observation period. Men with the highest LTPA level had significantly lower mean CAC, IMT (p < 0.01), and significantly higher mean RHI (p < 0.05) compared to the least active group. On final examination men with high PA had also the most favorable cardiovascular profile. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results indicate the protective effect of high LTPA level in the context of subclinical atherosclerosis in men."

lung cancer	cigarette smoking	Causes	24672690	test	T2	T3	76:87	156:173	"Preoperative evaluation for lung cancer resection. 
During the last decades lung cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide for both sexes. Even though cigarette smoking has been proved to be the main causative factor, many other agents (e.g., occupational exposure to asbestos or heavy metals, indoor exposure to radon gas radiation, particulate air pollution) have been associated with its development. Recently screening programs proved to reduce mortality among heavy-smokers although establishment of such strategies in everyday clinical practice is much more difficult and unknown if it is cost effective compared to other neoplasms (e.g., breast or prostate cancer). Adding severe comorbidities (coronary heart disease, COPD) to the above reasons as cigarette smoking is a common causative factor, we could explain the low surgical resection rates (approximately 20-30%) for lung cancer patients. Three clinical guidelines reports of different associations have been published (American College of Chest Physisians, British Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society/European Society of Thoracic Surgery) providing detailed algorithms for preoperative assessment. In the current mini review, we will comment on the preoperative evaluation of lung cancer patients."

During the last decades lung cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide for both sexes. Even though cigarette smoking has been proved to be the main causative factor, many other agents (e.g., occupational exposure to asbestos or heavy metals, indoor exposure to radon gas radiation, particulate air pollution) have been associated with its development. Recently screening programs proved to reduce mortality among heavy-smokers although establishment of such strategies in everyday clinical practice is much more difficult and unknown if it is cost effective compared to other neoplasms (e.g., breast or prostate cancer). Adding severe comorbidities (coronary heart disease, COPD) to the above reasons as cigarette smoking is a common causative factor, we could explain the low surgical resection rates (approximately 20-30%) for lung cancer patients. Three clinical guidelines reports of different associations have been published (American College of Chest Physisians, British Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society/European Society of Thoracic Surgery) providing detailed algorithms for preoperative assessment.

bulimia nervosa	psychotherapy	Treats	11034689	test	T7	T6	262:277	173:186	"Psychotherapy for bulimia nervosa and binging. 
BACKGROUND: Bulimia nervosa and like syndromes, such as binge eating disorder, are common in young Western women. A specific psychotherapy, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been developed for the treatment of bulimia nervosa. Other psychotherapies, some from a different theroretical framework, some modifications of CBT are also used. OBJECTIVES: The review aims to evaluate the psychotherapeutic treatments for those with binge eating syndromes, that have been tested in randomised controlled trials. Specifically, CBT therapy is compared with waiting list or a non-treatment group, any other psychotherapy, CBT in a ""pure self-help"" form and CBT augmented by exposure and response therapy. As well, the review aims to evaluate the evidence for the efficacy of other psychotherapies when compared to a no treatment control group and to evaluate the evidence for the efficacy of other psychotherapies when compared to a 'placebo' therapy. SEARCH STRATEGY: Handsearch of The International Journal of Eating Disorders since its first issue; database searches of MEDLINE, EXTRAMED, EMBASE, PSYCHLIT, CURRENT CONTENTS, LILACS, SCISEARCH, The Cochrane Collaboration Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Database of Trials; citation list searching and personal approaches to authors communication are used. SELECTION CRITERIA: All studies that have tested any form of psychotherapy for adult patients with non-purging bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and/or EDNOS of a bulimic type, and which have applied a randomised controlled and standardized outcome methodology, are sought for the purpose of this review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data are entered into a spreadsheet programme, and into the REVMAN analysis program. Relative risk analyses are conducted of binary outcome data. The relative risk analysis is used rather than the odds ratio as the outcome measures proposed are not measuring a rare event (such as death) and the total number of studies is small. Standardized mean difference analyses are conducted of continuous variable outcome data, as the continuous outcome measures are not consistent across studies. Sensitivity analyses are conducted of a number of measures of trial quality. Data were not reported in such a way to permitsubgroup analyses, but the effect of treatment on depressive symptoms, psychosocial and/or interpersonal functioning, general psychiatric symptoms and weight is examined where possible. Chi-square tests for homogeneity are done, at 5% level of significance, using a fixed effects model. Funnel plots to evaluate presence of publication bias are completed and available in a text file upon request. MAIN RESULTS: To date, more than 1360 trials have been generated by searching and 63 trials have been evaluated in detail. Because of a relatively high number of exclusions (n=12) the trial inclusion criteria were broadened to include those with non-blinded outcome assessment, providing 25 trials for analyses. Because of incomplete published and available data, at best up to 10 studies had data available for any single analysis. The maximum number of total patients included in a single analysis is 543. The majority of studies (21) evaluate patients with bulimia nervosa of a purging type. CBT is superior to waiting list controls with respect to abstinence from binge eating (RR 0.64 CI.53-.78). CBT just fails to be significantly superior to other psychotherapies with respect to abstinence from binge eating (RR.79, CI.61-1.04). CBT in a full or less intensive form is not significantly superior to CBT in a pure self-help form. Augmentation of CBT with exposure therapy is not more effective than CBT alone. Non CBT-psychotherapies also have significantly greater abstinence rates in comparisons with wait-list controls, but there is a paucity of such studies (RR 0.67, CI.56-.81, n=3 studies). Funnel plots suggest a bias towards publication of positive outcome studies only. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is small body of evidence for the efficacy of cognitive-behaviour therapy in bulimia nervosa and similar syndromes, but the quality of trials is very variable (e.g. the majority are not blinded) and sample sizes are often very small. More trials are needed, particularly for binge eating disorder and other EDNOS syndromes, and evaluating other psychotherapies and less intensive psychotherapies."

OBJECTIVE: The prospective relationship between cross-country skiing and hypertension is uncertain. We aimed to assess the associations of leisure time cross-country skiing habits with incident hypertension in a general population. METHODS: The frequency, average duration, and intensity of leisure cross-country skiing were assessed at baseline using a 12-month physical activity questionnaire in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease prospective study of 1809 middle-aged men without hypertension. Hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] were calculated. RESULTS: New onset diagnosis of hypertension was observed in 279 participants during a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 24.7 (18.1-26.8) years. Total volume and duration of cross-country skiing were continuously associated with hypertension risk. In analyses adjusted for hypertension risk factors, when compared with men with no cross-country skiing activity, the hazard ratios (95% CIs) of incident hypertension were 0.75 (0.57-0.99) and 0.57 (0.41-0.79) for men who did 1-200 and more than 200 MET hours/year of cross-country skiing, respectively. Compared with men with no cross-country skiing activity, the corresponding adjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) for incident hypertension were 0.72 (0.55-0.94) and 0.62 (0.44-0.86) for men who did 1-60 min/week and more than 60 min/week of cross-country skiing, respectively. In subsidiary analyses, there were age-adjusted associations of cross-country skiing habits with risk of stroke and acute coronary events, but these were attenuated on further adjustment for several confounders.

METHODS: The frequency, average duration, and intensity of leisure cross-country skiing were assessed at baseline using a 12-month physical activity questionnaire in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease prospective study of 1809 middle-aged men without hypertension. Hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] were calculated. RESULTS: New onset diagnosis of hypertension was observed in 279 participants during a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 24.7 (18.1-26.8) years. Total volume and duration of cross-country skiing were continuously associated with hypertension risk. In analyses adjusted for hypertension risk factors, when compared with men with no cross-country skiing activity, the hazard ratios (95% CIs) of incident hypertension were 0.75 (0.57-0.99) and 0.57 (0.41-0.79) for men who did 1-200 and more than 200 MET hours/year of cross-country skiing, respectively. Compared with men with no cross-country skiing activity, the corresponding adjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) for incident hypertension were 0.72 (0.55-0.94) and 0.62 (0.44-0.86) for men who did 1-60 min/week and more than 60 min/week of cross-country skiing, respectively. In subsidiary analyses, there were age-adjusted associations of cross-country skiing habits with risk of stroke and acute coronary events, but these were attenuated on further adjustment for several confounders. Cross-country skiing habits were associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSION: Total volume as well as duration of leisure time cross-country skiing are each continuously, inversely, and independently associated with future risk of hypertension in a white male population."

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To investigate whether the progression from prediabetes to diabetes is lower among those who undertake Ningen Dock (comprehensive health checkups with lifestyle education and doctor's consultation) than those who undertake basic mandatory occupational health checkups. METHODS AND RESULTS: Subjects aged 30-69 years with complete annual data from 2008 to 2012 for either Ningen Dock or basic health checkups were enrolled. Subjects with prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose 100-125 mg/dl or HbA1c 5.7-6.4%) at baseline were selected (14,928 in the comprehensive group and 10,433 in the basic group). The incidence of diabetes (fasting plasma glucose >= 126 mg/dl, HbA1c >= 6.5% or taking glucose-lowering drugs) and the reduction of risk factors were compared. After 4 years, 3226 cases of diabetes occurred among 25,361 subjects with prediabetes. The incidence of diabetes was lower in the comprehensive group than the basic group (2.9 vs. 3.8 cases/100 person-years, hazard ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.68-0.81 after adjustment). Moreover, more overweight subjects controlled their body mass index (16.2% vs. 13.2%) and more began a daily exercise habit (11.8% vs. 8.5%) in the comprehensive group than in the basic group. The incidence of diabetes was lower in subjects who could control their weight or start daily exercise at year 1 in the comprehensive group. CONCLUSION: Progression from prediabetes to diabetes was significantly lower in subjects undertaking a comprehensive health checkup with lifestyle education. Lifestyle education at health checkup for people with prediabetes might prevent progression to diabetes by reducing modifiable risk factors."

BACKGROUND: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a frequently occurring neurodevelopmental disorder, symptoms of which first appear in early childhood. Etiology of ADHD is not well understood. We investigated whether outdoor air pollution and greenspace affect ADHD incidence in children residing in Saxony. METHODS: 66,823 children, all beneficiaries of the statutory health insurance company AOK PLUS and born between 2000 and 2004, were followed until 2014. We considered any child with at least one ICD-10-GM F90 diagnosis by a child/adolescent psychiatrist, neuropaediatrician, or psychotherapist an ADHD case. Children's home addresses were known up to their four-digit postal code area. Population-weighted mean values of particulate matter with diameter of < 10 mum (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated for 186 postal code areas. Associations with each exposure were assessed by two-level adjusted Poisson regression models. RESULTS: 2044 children (3.06%) were diagnosed with ADHD within the observation period. An increase of PM10 and NO2 by 10 mug/m(3) raised the relative risk of ADHD by a factor of 1.97 [95% CI: 1.35-2.86] and 1.32 [1.10-1.58], respectively. A 0.1-unit increase in NDVI decreased the relative risk of ADHD by a factor of 0.82 [0.68-0.98]. Better access to child/adolescent psychiatrists was the most important confounder that increased ADHD risk across all models. CONCLUSION: Our results provide some evidence that air pollution might affect ADHD. Future studies with more detailed address information and better control for confounders, in particular socioeconomic status and parental psychopathology, should replicate the observed associations."
