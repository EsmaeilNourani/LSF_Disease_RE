# Lifestyle-Disease Relation Extraction

This is a forked repository with minor updates to adapt the system for training on the Disease Lifestyle relation corpus (LSD600) and to use it for Disease-Lifestyle relation extraction.

For more information, please visit the original repository: [https://github.com/farmeh/RegulaTome_extraction] and the [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.30.591824v1).


There are two main folders:
1. Code for training the torch-based relation extraction system on RegulaTome training data.
2. Code for large-scale extraction of biomedical relations from the literature, using the trained relation extraction system.
